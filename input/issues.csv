1657618,13,ACEP Website Vulnerablity,"Hi Vanessa,

I realize that I have not officially started yet but I was familiarizing myself with the ACEP team on the ACEP website when I discovered a minor security issue which allows anyone on the Internet to modify the ACEP directory details.  I wanted to bring this to your attention.  Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or need assistance.

**Summary**

The lax sharing setting on the [ACEP team database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iQU9tqWi0De4E0Da7pn4G7cADmtr0srJx9bLG4PwjWw/edit#gid=0) google spreadsheet permits anyone with the like to modify the content.  This makes it very easy for anyone to deface the ACEP website team directory with malicious or embarrassing content.  This includes modifying directory metadata and replacing people's headshot image URL links with other images.

**Risks and Impacts**

*   Likelihood:  Low to Moderate
*   Impact: Moderate

The chances that someone or some botnet will find and exploit this risk is very possible, but not likely as it has not yet been exploited.  If this vulnerability is exploited the impacts to ACEP may include:

*   Possible loss of directory information making it difficult to recover.
*   Embarrassment and loss of confidence in ACEP resulting from a defaced website.
*   Social Engineering or redirected contact info for identity theft or other malicious purposes.

**Recommended Resolution**

1.  Designate individual persons (@[alaska.edu](http://alaska.edu/) accounts) _**Editor**_ access to the [ACEP team database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iQU9tqWi0De4E0Da7pn4G7cADmtr0srJx9bLG4PwjWw/edit#gid=0) [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iQU9tqWi0De4E0Da7pn4G7cADmtr0srJx9bLG4PwjWw/edit#gid=0) Share option.
2.  Change the Sharing permissions for General Access to:  _**Anyone with the link:  Viewer**_

This will give explicit permission to those who need edit permission, yet still allow anyone (and any website) on the Internet the ability to view the spreadsheet details.

**Incident / Vulnerability Reporting**

I assume this ACEP Website is an OU Campus website administered by OIT.

*   If so then OIT may have also set up directory pages for other departments in a similar manner.
*   I would advise forwarding this email to the UA OIT security group: [security@alaska.edu](mailto:security@alaska.edu)
*   Or submit a ticket via: [https://www.alaska.edu/securitymatters/](https://www.alaska.edu/securitymatters/)

**Technical Details**

*   From the Team directory page: [https://www.uaf.edu/acep/about/our-team/index.php](https://www.uaf.edu/acep/about/our-team/index.php)
*   One can see that the site loads the script: [https://www.uaf.edu/acep/about/our-team/directory.js](https://www.uaf.edu/acep/about/our-team/directory.js)
*   Which contains the ACEP team database Google Spreadsheet link: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iQU9tqWi0De4E0Da7pn4G7cADmtr0srJx9bLG4PwjWw/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iQU9tqWi0De4E0Da7pn4G7cADmtr0srJx9bLG4PwjWw/edit#gid=0)

*   The **Share** setting for this spreadsheet permits _**Anyone with the link**_ full Edit permissions to the spreadsheet.

Fun to have you coming onboard John.

I am looking to leave behind a remote access method for a data server deployment.

I kind of want to have an agent that allow similar capabilities of ngrok/cloudflare

I would like to find a sane/safe way of doing this.

So yeah, cloudflare or tailscale agents would be my default target.

As promised, here is the agenda for the ARCTIC site visit happening next week. ONR's Michele Anderson and Mike Resner arrive in Anchorage tomorrow and will depart Saturday after a whirlwind tour of Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Kotzebue. During this time ARCTIC researchers & leadership will be presenting on ARCTIC research and community engagement:

*   Monday morning in Anchorage,
*   Thursday all day in Fairbanks, and
*   Friday all day in Kotzebue

This year's site visit also features some different approaches to updating our program officers including facilitated conversations with other decision-makers and federal funders in Alaska, and an interactive presentation style in the form of a guided poster session.

Monday 9/11 5pm  
 

King Street Brewing, Anchorage

& 

Friday 9/15 5pm

I can share the notes from when they were there - basically I'm asking the questions from CMMC 2.0 Level 1 - if they can become compliant with those then they'll meet Sean's goal for departmental cyber hygiene - the problem with ACEP and Sikuliaq is that there are business processes separate from research processes - so when we interviewed ACEP, Dayne was very clear on the separation - which I'm in full agreement of. The devices/users that deal with CUI are different than the devices/users that attend to the business processes

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rise of more sophisticated and powerful attacks makes immediate attention to security essential. Here's how various stakeholders can contribute to a more secure digital ecosystem:

#### **1\. Protect your IoT from being infected.**[**#**](https://thehackernews.com/2023/09/ddos-20-iot-sparks-new-ddos-alert.html#1-protect-your-iot-from-being-infected)

*   **Educate on safe IoT practices:** Encourage home and corporate users to change default passwords, update firmware, and adhere to best practices to prevent devices from being compromised. Many companies, like [SANS Institute](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/iot-penetration-testing/), offer training on IoT security and penetration testing.
*   **Collaborate and threat share:** Initiatives like the [Cyber Threat Alliance](https://www.cyberthreatalliance.org/) and the [Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/partnerships-and-collaboration/joint-cyber-defense-collaborative) unite governments, tech companies, and cybersecurity firms to rapidly detect and neutralize emerging threats, strengthening collective global defenses.
*   **Regularly update devices:** Ensure IoT devices are updated with the latest firmware and patches to prevent known vulnerabilities from being exploited.

#### **2\. Protect against IoT-driven botnet DDoS attacks.**[**#**](https://thehackernews.com/2023/09/ddos-20-iot-sparks-new-ddos-alert.html#2-protect-against-iotdriven-botnet-ddos-attacks)

*   **Implement multi-layer security protocols**: Deploy a [comprehensive security strategy](https://gcore.com/learning/cybersecurity-solutions-overview/), from firewalls and intrusion detection systems to web application security solutions.
*   **Invest in** [**Specialized DDoS Protection Solutions**](https://gcore.com/ddos-protection?utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=iot): Companies like Gcore have developed solutions explicitly designed to combat even massive, IoT-driven DDoS attacks.

NOT URGENT, PLEASE RESPOND AS YOU HAVE TIME.

I'm interested in maybe creating a few ACEP UAF Google Groups / Departmental Accounts and wanted to consult with your first before doing so.  There is no rush on this so we can talk when you have time.

If ACEP already has SOP's related to managing ACEP Google Group and Departmental accounts I would like to follow those practices.  If not I'm happy to advise on a few simple practices that can simplify business continuity considerations for ACEP in this regard.   Again there is no urgency on this matter.

The emails I'm interested in creating are:

*   [uaf-acep-infosec@alaska.edu](mailto:uaf-acep-infosec@alaska.edu) - Google Group - ACEP Cybersecurity Realted Thread Discussions
*   [uaf-acep-security@alaska.edu](mailto:uaf-acep-security@alaska.edu) - Departmental account - for Incident Response, Security Relate Services.
*   [uaf-acep-data@alaska.edu](mailto:uaf-acep-data@alaska.edu) - Google Group - ACEP Data Team Distribution List (I would also consult with the Data Team before creating this resource)

Hi Alex:

Thanks for reaching out! I'd be happy to jump on a call. I've added a few people to this thread:

*   Mr. John Haverlack has been with UAF for awhile, but recently joined the ACEP team to work on cybersecurity
*   Mr. Tom Hough is the UAF DoD Liaison and may have some ideas of other cybersecurity experts at UAF that could be a helpful as a resource
*   Mr. Jeremy Kasper, ACEP Director, is BCC'd for situational awareness

I've got a great relationship with both ToniAnn and Claire, and I know UAF is very interested in more partnerships with the Air Force. With the increasing concern and interest in this area, I believe it's a great opportunity for UAF to support such an effort. Thanks for thinking of us!

Thanks,

**Brittany Smart**

John - wanted to share this scope of work from the data team that would support Dominique & Alana's work on home heating costs. This seems related to your past experience and also may be useful for your orientation to ACEP research & data challenges.

let me know if you're interested in working on this a little bit, perhaps with Solomon and Dayne.

ACT 1 Phase 1 Commitment Submission
-----------------------------------

> Phase 1. Commitment: utilities describe their resources, need for improving their cybersecurity                       
> posture, and commitment to participating in the ACT 1 Prize Program.

*   Submission Due 2023-11-29
*   Describe need, goals, service territory, and demonstrate commitment
*   Prize Awarded to ~55 winners ~March 2024
*   Award: $50k / 60 hours Technical Assistance

> Funding is provided to winners for work that has already been performed. Once a prize is awarded, winners determine how best to use the funds, with no further commitments.

#### 1.1 Goal

> The goal of the Commitment Phase is to begin identifying the cybersecurity improvements your utility                 
> would like to accomplish and gaining your leadership’s commitment to making improvements. In the                 
> Commitment Phase, you will describe why your utility should qualify as a limited cybersecurity resources                 
> utility if you are competing in the LIMITED CYBERSECURITY RESOURCES track. Utilities in both tracks                 
> must describe the utility’s current cybersecurity maturity level and demonstrate in your submission                 
> package that your utility and its staff have the capacity to work with TA providers. Utilities will need to                 
> provide a letter of support from their authorizing official (CEO, general manager, or governing board)                 
> supporting staff resources and time to this effort and affirming the utility’s commitment to fully                 
> participate. The RMUC Program recognizes the economic challenges many rural communities face, and                 
> competitors will also be asked to describe their utility service territory, the communities they serve, and                 
> the work they do to support disadvantaged communities in their service territory.                 
> Submission packages for the Commitment Prize will be evaluated based on the following criteria (See                 
> Section 1.4 for more information):
> 
> *   Criterion 1: **Utility Need and Cybersecurity Maturity Level**
> *   Criterion 2: **Initial Goals, Expected Outcomes, and Impacts on Utility**
> *   Criterion 3: **Commitment to Implement Cybersecurity Improvements and Capacity to Utilize TA**
> *   Criterion 4: **Description of Service Territory and Community Benefits**.
> 
> Priority will be given to utilities that have limited cybersecurity resources and cybersecurity capabilities,                 
> have a commitment and capacity to work with TA providers, have strong leadership support, and/or serve                 
> a high proportion of low-income and disadvantaged communities.

#### 1.3 What to Submit for the Commitment Prize

> To apply for a Commitment Prize, the utility must:
> 
> • **Have a staff member attend two required ACT 1 Prize Program workshops**
> 
> • Upload a submission package that includes all the items listed below:
> 
> 1\. **Cover page and narrative**
> 
> 2\. **Letter of support from your organization’s authorizing official (e.g., CEO, general manager, board of directors, etc.)**

*   Develop and implement processes to ensure solutions are installed securely and perform as intended.

> The ACT 1 Prize Program will prioritize utilities eligible to participate in the RMUC Program that have                       
> limited cybersecurity resources or serve military installations. Utilities are strongly encouraged to apply if                       
> they: (1) have limited economic and staff resources; (2) have limited access to cybersecurity training, TA,                       
> and support services; and (3) have a low cybersecurity maturity level.  Utilities that serve military                       
> installations are also strongly encouraged to apply.

Successful utilities in the ACT 1 Prize Program competition will **identify cybersecurity risks**, **identify solutions** that **reduce or eliminate** those risks, and **implement selected solutions**. Work completed by these utilities should accomplish one or more of the following goals: 

*   A) Increase a utility’s ability to identify cybersecurity threats within their information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) systems Page 8 of 45
*   B) Improve a utility’s ability to protect against cybersecurity threats
*   C) Improve a utility’s ability to detect cybersecurity events and incidents soon after they occur
*   D) Prepare a utility to respond to and mitigate damage from a cybersecurity incident rapidly and effectively
*   E) Recover from a cybersecurity incident and identify and implement process improvements.

> Phase 1: Commitment. **Competitors will describe their utility’s need for assistance, the communities they serve**, and their **commitment to improving their utility’s cybersecurity posture**. The **50 limited cybersecurity resource** utilities and 5 utilities serving military installations that most successfully describe and demonstrate their cybersecurity needs, capacity to work with TA providers, and leadership commitment to the Program will be selected to win a Commitment Prize. Only utilities that have won a Commitment Prize are eligible to enter the Planning Phase and compete for a Planning Prize.

### Legal / Security

1.  Care must be taken not to submit sensitive details to the submissions process.
2.  Some risk is being created by the information that HeroX collects.
3.  It would be good to have a Legal Council review the following TOS documents.

#### A.9 Liability

> **Upon registration, all participants agree to assume any and all risks of injury or loss in connection with or**               
> **in any way arising from participation in this contest.** Upon registration, except in the case of willful

Dear All Collaborators of NSF-MRI grant,

CONGRATULATIONS!!!! 

We have received the funding (approx. $910K USD) for our proposal titled 'Equipment: MRI Track-I: Acquisition of CyBR: Cyber Infrastructure for Big Data Research Critical for Alaska'. 

My sincere thanks to all the twenty four co-authors from both UAF and UAA who contributed to the proposal with their thoughtful research/education ideas. As a PI of the proposal I really hope that this instrument will help advance all your research activities. I believe this instrumentation will be a major driver for the University of Alaska (UA) Statewide System to pursue research activities that are really critical for Alaska's wellbeing, especially those which are data-intensive and/or computationally challenging. I also hope this It will play a major role in improving the UA system's technology education infrastructure contributing significantly towards building the state's future hitech workforce.

My sincere THANKS to the INE proposal office, OGCA, tam and the proposal offices of each collaborator for preparing the budget, budget-justification, review work, and other activities that made the submission process meticulously correct and smooth. A very special THANK to Sandra Boatwright who is retired now but led the entire effort even on her last day at work when NSF asked for the updated CPOSs from all the Co-PIs and Senior Personnel.

My sincere thanks to Kelvin Chu and his TIG team for reviewing my proposal before submission and suggesting the modifications that ended up in a successful award.

Finally, I would also like to thank all the Deans, Directors, and VCR for their support starting from white paper competition, its selection, and providing all the prerequisites including the research environments, labs, contacts, letters of support, and other administrative support. 

In the end, as a second year Assistant Professor at UAF (about to submit my last year documents in Faculty 180 😆 ), I would like to express my sincere THANKS to you all for supporting me as a PI and contributing to the proposal. I really appreciate all your efforts. IT REALLY MEANS A LOT.

I will update the project status from time to time and will organize meetings with you to decide the next steps. 

Thanks and Regards,
Arghya Kusum Das,

Yep.

Nothing to worry about anytime soon. I am sure it is a year out before any services are figured out but interesting to see they got traction NSF funding for on campus compute at UAF.",,,,,jehaverlack,John Haverlack,jehaverlack,John Haverlack,New,Normal,Normal,Project,False,0,,"acep,research",[],0,2023-09-21 17:27:42.218326+00:00,2023-09-27 18:39:30.389025+00:00,,,
1662720,97,Github TOS,"Has ACEP Reviewed Github TOS for Federal Agencies?

**Terms of Service**  
 

From a 2023-02-13 email I sent to CFOS students

> A few points to consider before using [github.com](http://github.com/) for University related repositories:
>

> 4.  Be careful when creating non-UA accounts on external vendor sites ([github.com](http://github.com/))  It maybe more advisable to contact OIT about using UA's Github server:   [https://github.alaska.edu/](https://github.alaska.edu/)   (This also mostly addresses business continuity, ToS and other security concerns.)

**UA Github**

We have [github.alaska.edu](http://github.alaska.edu/) linked to our @[alaska.edu](http://alaska.edu/) accounts.   However this resource is for UA use only and not for publishing or collaborating outside of UA.  While this service is still online I've heard it will be going away but don't have a hard ETA on this.  I used to use this to internally host SKQ repos: [https://github.alaska.edu/skq](https://github.alaska.edu/skq)  However have move all of those repositories over to [https://ci.sikuliaq.alaska.edu/git/skqit](https://ci.sikuliaq.alaska.edu/git/skqit)  (Self hosted) to avoid getting cut off when [github.alaska.edu](http://github.alaska.edu/) goes away.

I've reached out to Liam Forbes (RCS) to see if he knows more about the status of this and what is the prefered UAF Github resource.  Standing by for a response.

**Office of Intellectual Property**

Per a contract letter I recently signed:

> Ownership of intellectual property you may produce is governed by University [Regulation 10.07.05](https://www.alaska.edu/bor/policy-regulations/chapter-10-07-research-scholarship-creative-activity.php#P10.07.050) or, if  
> applicable, the terms of a collective bargaining agreement.

My interpretation of this has been that I'm not at liberty to share code or works that UAF paid me to produce with those outside of UAF without prior permission.

There may be some exceptions if we receive grant funding for the purposes of collaboration with persons outside of UAF. 

I would advise contacting the UAF Office of Intellectual Property and Commercialization [https://www.uaf.edu/oipc/](https://www.uaf.edu/oipc/) to get that permission.  
 

FYI I did work with UAF OIPC to license the ITAM project so that I could share it with others in the fleet.  It was a fairly easy process of proposing and ISC license and getting written permission to publish this codebase.

*   [https://www.sikuliaq.alaska.edu/git/skq/skq-it-am](https://www.sikuliaq.alaska.edu/git/skq/skq-it-am)

**If you get their permission in writing then it clear sailing to share code and works from there on.**

**Open Source License**

Choice of license is important.  I strongly recommend that any work use a permissive license such as:

*   [MIT](https://opensource.org/license/MIT/)
*   [BSD 3 Clause](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause/)
*   [ISC](https://opensource.org/license/isc-license-txt/)

I advise against restrictive or wordy licenses such at GPL or Apache.",,,,,jehaverlack,John Haverlack,jehaverlack,John Haverlack,New,Normal,Normal,Administrative,False,0,,"acep,data,legal",[],0,2023-09-21 18:08:10.752961+00:00,2023-09-27 18:39:25.208115+00:00,,,

John studied physics at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/) in the early '90s and taught high school [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science%2C_technology%2C_engineering%2C_and_mathematics) in [central](https://svgs.k12.va.us/) and [western](https://ahs.ahps.k12.va.us/) Virginia for ~5 years. Since 1991, he has been a Linux administrator and even played a role in installing the first [Linux](http://www.slackware.com/) system at Virginia Tech. Professionally, he has worked in the private sector for companies such as [Transmeta, Inc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmeta), and [Sourceforge, Inc](https://sourceforge.net/). John came to [UAF](https://www.uaf.edu/uaf/) in 2002, initially with the [Alaska Satellite Facility](https://asf.alaska.edu/).   Since 2009, he has served as the IT manager for the UAF [College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/).  There he has been intimately involved in the design, deployment and maintenance of cyberinfrastructure onboard the [R/V _Sikuliaq_](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/sikuliaq/). Parallel to his _Sikuliaq_ role, John has also been a consultant to the [U.S. Academic Research Fleet](https://www.unols.org/) assisting with the development of a new cybersecurity program. In his spare time, John pursues interest in [physics](https://wolframphysics.org/visual-summary/dark/), [decentralized technologies](https://appliedbitlogistics.io/podci/), and dabbles in amateur woodworking and an offgrid solar energy project around his home in Fairbanks Alaska.

1664167,120,Quick question - A.I. notetaking (Patty Eagan,"Hi John, (I sit in that back area by you, but work remotely some times)

Since you're a security and technology guru.. quick question! (No worries if this is not your wheelhouse)

Do you know if UAF has guidance about the A.I.-linked bot accounts that join Zoom meetings sometimes? We precautiously have been removing them from ACEP-hosted meetings since it was new and folks wanted to learn more before accepting everything AI was noting on our internal meetings.

For context, I help host monthly hydrogen energy working group meetings with a wide variety of non-UAF folks, so would like to respect others while following UAF protocols since it's a UAF hosted meeting.

Thank you,

Patty

Would you like to chat further?  I'm happy to schedule a Zoom meeting or if you're in Fairbanks we can chat in-person.  I need to get the scoping document sent back to them in about two weeks so let's talk before if possible.  The attached slide deck will provide a little more detail on the engagement.

The ioninja device can be found here:

In particular, we have the very basic ethernet tap and no additional modules.

[https://ioninja.com/hardware/ethernet-tap.html](https://ioninja.com/hardware/ethernet-tap.html)

It is quite an upgrade to wireshark. It will export pcap logs that can be later used in wireshark if that is a preferred workflow. The amount of extra modules is a bit staggering.

### 1 Introduction

> This document provides guidance on how to secure operational technology (OT) while                  
> addressing their unique performance, reliability, and safety requirements. OT encompasses a                  
> broad range of programmable systems and devices that interact with the physical environment                  
> (or manage devices that interact with the physical environment). These systems and devices                  
> detect or cause a direct change through the monitoring and/or control of devices, processes, and                  
> events. Examples include industrial control systems, building automation systems, transportation                  
> systems, physical access control systems, physical environment monitoring systems, and                  
> physical environment measurement systems. The document provides an overview of OT and                  
> typical system topologies, identifies common threats and vulnerabilities to these systems, and                  
> provides recommended security countermeasures to mitigate the associated risks

*   Additional alignment with other OT security standards and guidelines, including the Cybersecurity Framework
*   New tailoring guidance for NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5 security controls
*   An OT overlay for NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5 security controls that provides tailored security control baselines for low-, moderate-, and high-impact OT systems

> Initially, OT had little resemblance to traditional information technology (IT) systems because                
> OT systems were isolated, ran proprietary control protocols, and used specialized hardware and                
> software. As OT systems adopt IT solutions to enable corporate business systems connectivity                
> and remote access capabilities and are designed and implemented using industry-standard                
> computers, operating systems (OSs), and network protocols, they have begun to resemble IT                
> systems. This integration supports new IT capabilities, but it provides significantly less isolation                
> for OT from the outside world than predecessor systems, creating a greater need to secure OT                
> systems. The increasing use of wireless networking places OT implementations at greater risk                
> from adversaries who are in relatively close physical proximity but do not have direct physical                
> access to the equipment. While security solutions have been designed to deal with these issues in                
> typical IT systems, special precautions must be taken when introducing these same solutions to                
> OT environments. In some cases, new security solutions that are tailored to the OT environment                
> are needed.
> 
> OT cybersecurity programs should always be part of broader OT safety and reliability programs                
> at both industrial sites and enterprise cybersecurity programs because cybersecurity is essential                
> to the safe and reliable operation of modern industrial processes.
> 
> Possible incidents that an OT system may face include:                
> •Blocked or delayed flow of information through OT networks, which could disrupt OT                
> operation, including loss of view and loss of control                
> •Unauthorized changes to instructions, commands, or alarm thresholds that could damage,                
> disable, or shut down equipment, create environmental impacts, and/or endanger human                
> life                
> •Inaccurate information sent to system operators, either to disguise unauthorized changes                
> or to cause operators to initiate inappropriate actions that could have various negative                
> effects                
> •Modified OT software or configuration settings or OT software infected with malware,                
> which could have various negative effects                
> •Interference with the operation of equipment protection systems, which could endanger                
> costly and difficult-to-replace equipment                
> •Interference with the operation of safety systems, which could endanger human life
> 
> **Major security objectives for an OT implementation should include the following:**
> 
> *   Restrict logical access to the OT network, network activity, and systems.
> *   Restrict physical access to the OT network and devices.
> *   Protect individual OT components from exploitation.
> *   Restrict unauthorized modification of data.
> *   Detect security events and incidents.
> *   Maintain functionality during adverse conditions.
> *   Restore and recover the system after an incident.
> 
> At a minimum, the cybersecurity team should                
> consist of a member of the organization’s IT staff, a control engineer, a control system operator,                
> a network and system security expert, a member of the management staff, and a member of the                
> physical security department.
> 
> The cybersecurity team                
> should coordinate closely with site management (e.g., facility superintendent) and the company’s                
> Chief Information Officer (CIO) or Chief Security Officer (CSO), who – along with the Chief                
> Executive Officer (CEO) or Chief Operating Officer (COO) – accepts complete responsibility                
> and accountability for the cybersecurity of the OT system and for any safety incidents, reliability                
> incidents, or equipment damage caused directly or indirectly by cyber incidents.
> 
> **In a typical OT system, a defense-in-depth strategy includes:**                
> •Developing security policies, procedures, training, and educational material that apply                
> specifically to the OT system                
> •Considering OT security policies and procedures based on the [National Terrorism](https://www.dhs.gov/national-terrorism-advisory-system)                
> [Advisory System](https://www.dhs.gov/national-terrorism-advisory-system) and deploying increasingly heightened security postures as the Threat                
> Level increases                
> •Addressing security throughout the life cycle of the OT system, including architecture                
> design, procurement, installation, operations, maintenance, and decommissioning
> 
> •Implementing a network topology for the OT system that has multiple layers, with the                
> most critical communications occurring in the most secure and reliable layer                
> •**Providing logical separation between the corporate and OT networks (e.g., stateful**                
> **inspection firewalls between the networks, unidirectional gateways)**                
> •Considering where physical separation may be required as opposed to logical separation                
> •Employing a DMZ network architecture (e.g., prevent direct traffic between the corporate                
> and OT networks)                
> •**Using multi-factor authentication for remote access to the OT system**                
> •Ensuring that critical components are redundant and are on redundant networks                
> •Designing critical systems for graceful degradation (fault tolerant) to prevent catastrophic                
> cascading events                
> •**Disabling unused ports and services on OT devices after testing to ensure that this will**                
> **not impact OT operation**                
> •Restricting physical access to the OT network and devices                
> •**Restricting OT user privileges to only those that are required to perform each user’s**                
> **function (e.g., establishing role-based access control, configuring each role based on the**                
> **principle of least privilege)**                
> •**Using separate authentication mechanisms and credentials for users of the OT network**                
> **and the corporate network (i.e., OT network accounts do not use corporate network user**                
> **accounts)**                
> •**Using modern technology, such as smart cards for user authentication**                
> •**Implementing security controls (e.g., intrusion detection software, antivirus software, file**                
> **integrity checking software) where technically feasible to prevent, deter, detect, and**                
> **mitigate the introduction, exposure, and propagation of malicious software to, within, and**                
> **from the OT system**                
> •**Applying security techniques, such as encryption and/or cryptographic hashes, to OT data**                
> **storage and communications where appropriate**                
> •**Expeditiously deploying security patches after testing all patches under field conditions**                
> **on a test system, if possible, before installation on the OT system**                
> •**Tracking and monitoring audit trails on critical areas of the OT system**

> The system can be configured in one of three ways:              
> •Open loop: The output is controlled by established settings.              
> •Closed loop: The output affects the input in such a way as to maintain the desired control              
> objective.              
> •Manual mode: The system is completely controlled by humans.

> For example, both the electrical power transmission and distribution grid industries use             
> geographically distributed SCADA control technology to operate highly interconnected and             
> dynamic systems that consist of thousands of public and private utilities and rural cooperatives             
> for supplying electricity to end users. Some SCADA systems monitor and control electricity             
> distribution by collecting data from and issuing commands to geographically remote field control

> The IIoT system architecture is fully distributed and can support a wide range of interactions and           
> communication paradigms, including:           
> •Peer-to-peer networking (e.g., security cameras communicating about identified objects)           
> •Edge-device collaboration (e.g., wind turbines in remote locations)           
> •Distributed queries across data stored in devices, in the cloud, and anywhere in between           
> •Distributed data management that defines where and what data is to be stored and for           
> how long           
> •Data governance, including quality, discovery, usability, privacy, and security

**Some special considerations when securing OT include:**

> *   Timeliness and performance requirements. - Low Latency prioritized over bandwidth capacity
> *   Availability requirements.
> *   Risk management requirements. - In a typical IT system, primary concerns include data           
>     confidentiality and integrity. For OT, primary concerns include safety, fault tolerance to           
>     prevent the loss of life or endangerment of public health or confidence, regulatory           
>     compliance, loss of equipment, loss of intellectual property, or lost or damaged products.
> *   Physical effects.
> *   System operation. - Control networks are typically managed by control engineers rather than IT personnel
> *   Resource constraints. - OT and their real-time operating systems (RTOSs) are often           
>     resource-constrained systems that do not include typical contemporary IT security           
>     capabilities. Legacy systems often lack resources that are common on modern IT           
>     systems. Many systems may also lack desired features, including encryption capabilities,           
>     error logging, and password protection. **Indiscriminate use of IT security practices in OT**           
>     **may cause availability and timing disruptions.** There may not be computing resources           
>     available on OT components to retrofit these systems with current security capabilities.           
>     Adding resources or features may not be possible.
> *   Communications. - Communication protocols and media used by OT environments for           
>     field device control and intra-processor communication are typically different from IT           
>     environments and may be proprietary.
> *   Change management. - Change management is paramount to maintaining the integrity of           
>     both IT and OT systems. Unpatched software represents one of the greatest           
>     vulnerabilities to a system.  These updates need to be thoroughly tested by both the vendor and the end user of the industrial control application before being implemented.The OT may also require revalidation as part of the update process.
> *   Managed support.
> *   Component lifetime. - the lifetime of the deployed technology is often in the order of 10 to 15 years and sometimes longer.
> *   Component location.

### 3 OT Cybersecurity Program Development

> To mitigate cybersecurity risks to their OT systems, organizations need to develop and deploy an           
> OT cybersecurity program.

**Establish a Charter for the OT Cybersecurity Program**

> Senior management must demonstrate a clear commitment to cybersecurity and communicate its           
> importance throughout the organization. Cybersecurity is a business responsibility shared by all           
> members of the organization, especially by its leaders and IT and OT teams.
> 
> As OT systems are increasingly being connected to IT networks, relying on traditional measures (e.g.,           
> air gaps) is not enough to protect such systems from cyber attacks. Therefore, security measures           
> tailored to the OT system are required to protect the organization.
> 
> The OT cybersecurity strategy leverages the organization-wide risk           
> management strategy – including organization-defined risk tolerance, threats, assumptions,           
> constraints, priorities, and trade-offs – to further tailor the strategy to apply to the OT           
> cybersecurity program.
> 
> The OT cybersecurity strategy:           
> •Refines and supplements guidance from the organization-wide risk management strategy           
> to address OT-specific constraints and requirements           
> •Identifies the OT cybersecurity team and personnel           
> •Addresses the OT cybersecurity operation model (e.g., insource, outsource, and/or use           
> managed security services)           
> •Outlines the appropriate cybersecurity architecture for the various OT sites within the OT           
> program           
> •Defines OT-specific cybersecurity training and awareness 
> 
> **Establish a Cybersecurity Awareness Training Program for the OT**           
> **Environment**           
> Organizations should ensure that all personnel who interact with OT systems – including           
> employees, contractors, consultants, and vendors – receive cybersecurity training that is relevant           
> to the OT environment in addition to general IT cybersecurity awareness training. This training           
> is used to inform personnel of basic cybersecurity principles, teach them about their potential           
> impacts on security and safety, and outline the steps that they need to follow when interacting           
> with OT systems. Cybersecurity awareness training should be required for new employees at the           
> time of hire and at regular intervals, as dictated by regulatory requirements and organizational           
> policies.
> 
> Implement a Risk Management Framework for OT

> **Develop a Maintenance Tracking Capability**
> 
> **Develop an Incident Response Capability**
> 
> **the risk management process has four components: framing**          
> **risk (i.e., establishing the context for risk-based decisions), assessing risk, responding to risk,**          
> **and monitoring risk.**

**Field I/O (Purdue Level 0) Security Considerations**

### 6 Applying the Cybersecurity Framework to OT

> The CSF Functions guide the following actions:
> 
> *   Identify (ID) – Develop an organizational     
>     understanding to manage cybersecurity risk to     
>     systems, people, assets, data, and capabilities.
> *   Protect (PR) – Develop and implement appropriate     
>     safeguards to ensure delivery of critical services.
> *   Detect (DE) – Develop and implement appropriate     
>     activities to identify the occurrence of the     
>     cybersecurity event.
> *   Respond (RS) – Develop and implement     
>     appropriate activities to take action regarding a     
>     detected cybersecurity incident.
> *   Recover (RC) – Develop and implement     
>     appropriate activities to maintain plans for     
>     resilience and to restore any capabilities or services     
>     that were impaired due to a cybersecurity incident.

#### Asset Management (ID.AM)

> The ability for organizations to properly and consistently identify and manage data, personnel,     
> devices, systems, and facilities based on their relative importance provides a foundational     
> capability to support an organizational cybersecurity program. Additionally, updating inventory     
> information when components are added, removed, or changed (e.g., patched, new firmware     
> installed, component swapped during maintenance) helps organizations accurately manage their     
> overall environmental risks. Organizations should consider including the following to support     
> their asset **management capability:**     
> **•Unique** identifiers to differentiate and track assets     
> •**Hardware inventory management** to track computing and network devices within the     
> environment, including device details and location. Device details may include vendor,     
> model, serial number, purchase information, and manufacturing/build information (e.g.,     
> provenance information).     
> •**Software and firmware inventory** management to track the software and firmware     
> installed with the OT components, including version numbers, location information, and     
> software bill of materials (SBOM)     
> •**Vendor information** to establish a repository of vendor information, points of contact,     
> warranty information, locations of recall, and update information     
> •**Documented roles and responsibilities** to identify specific individuals, teams, or     
> organization groups who represent the asset owner and those with operation,     
> maintenance, and cybersecurity roles and responsibilities

#### Identity Management and Access Control (PR.AC)

> Identity Management and Access Control (PR.AC) identifies outcomes around establishing and    
> managing the identification mechanisms and credentials for users, devices, and services. Identity    
> management supports the cybersecurity principle of positively and uniquely identifying and    
> authorizing a person, process, or device before granting physical or logical access to resources    
> such as the system, information, or location being protected. Access controls represent the    
> policies, processes, and technologies for specifying the use of system resources by only    
> authorized users, programs, processes, or other systems. PR.AC controls allow organizations to    
> manage logical and physical access to support system risk management requirements.    
> Supplemental guidance for implementing identity management and access control outcomes can    
> be found in the following documents:    
> •[NIST SP 800-63-3, Digital Identity Guidelines](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63-3)

D.2.1. Clean Energy Cybersecurity Accelerator Initiative   
This initiative is led by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Renewable   
Energy Laboratory (NREL) and brings together federal infrastructure and expertise, asset owners   
in the energy sector, and technology innovators in a unified effort to catalyze the development of   
new cybersecurity solutions for the Nation’s future clean energy grid.   
The Cybersecurity Accelerator program offers a world-class facility for asset owners of all sizes   
and types to work jointly to develop and deploy renewable, modern, and secure grid technologies   
that are cost competitive. These innovative technologies will also advance the state of the   
practice in demonstrating “security by design,” thus ensuring that cybersecurity is built into   
renewable technologies and architectures at the start of the design and development process, not   
bolted on after deployment.

D.2.2. Cybersecurity for Energy Delivery Systems (CEDS) R&D Program   
The Department of Energy (DOE) Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response   
(CESER) Office designed the CEDS R&D program in 2010 to develop cybersecurity solutions   
for energy delivery systems through a focused research and development effort. Since then, DOE   
CESER has invested more than $240 million with industry partners to make advances in   
cybersecurity capabilities for energy delivery systems. These research partnerships are helping to   
detect, prevent, and mitigate the consequences of a cyber incident for current and future energy   
delivery systems.

D.2.4. Cybersecurity Risk Information Sharing Program (CRISP)   
The Cybersecurity Risk Information Sharing Program (CRISP) is a public-private partnership   
that is co-funded by DOE and industry and managed by the Electricity Information Sharing and   
Analysis Center (E-ISAC) at NERC. The purpose of CRISP is to collaborate with energy-sector   
partners to facilitate the timely bidirectional sharing of unclassified and classified threat   
information and to develop situational awareness tools that enhance the sector’s ability to   
identify, prioritize, and coordinate the protection of critical infrastructure and key resources.   
CRISP leverages DOE’s advanced sensors, threat analysis techniques, and expertise to better   
inform the energy sector of high-level cyber risks. This information is shared with voluntary   
utility participants who collectively deliver more than 80 % of the Nation’s electricity. The   
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) plays a lead role at CRISP.

### My ACEP On-boarding Experience

*   Casandra provided me HR related information and required training links prior to starting with ACEP.  So I was able to complete these house keeping tasks before I started.
*   Jennifer Harris met me on day one and provided me with a tour of the office and
*   Vanessa provided me with the following excellent [Onboarding Haverlack](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-PwBJ9HJWixbLCDanRMN-sD6HapeA0mLarxNBmWZI48/edit#heading=h.t2vdc4gkznd) document

*   [Workstation Setup Docs](https://github.com/acep-uaf/workstation_setup_docs) (Provided by Vanessa)

### Additional things to consider

*   Perhaps an intranet website (aka. Wiki) accessible only to ACEP employees with links to all resources
*   An introduction and orientation to ACEP presentation / video
*   An ACEP Org Chart
*   An ACEP Facilities Chart / Map
*   Directory Information (ACEP website is good, but out of date)
*   Directory Information as a Spreadsheet or CSV
*   Directory Information as a Google Contact Upload
*   A database / spreadsheet of ACEP partners and contact info, perhaps with a location Map
*   A database / spreadsheet of ACEP projects and metadata
*   For techie types:  A network diagram of ACEP CI services

#### Procedures

*   A Shared Google Drive for ACEP Procedures (to have them all in one easy to find location)
*   User of Shared Google Drives and Google Groups for business continuity purposes
*   How do I get a phone number? or what is my phone number / ACEP Address information
*   Desk and Workstation:  It is really nice for new employees to have a desk, email address, and computer workstation on day one ready and waiting for them.  When these things are missing it can make a bad first impression on new hires. (This was not an issue for me, I'm just emphasizing the importance).",,,,,jehaverlack,John Haverlack,jehaverlack,John Haverlack,Closed,Important,High,Documentation,True,0,,"winter 23-24,onboarding,acep,hr",[],0,2023-09-29 21:54:39.013252+00:00,2023-10-20 20:45:41.498215+00:00,2023-10-16 23:43:34.626508+00:00,,

### **Preamble**

One of the grand challenges of data-intensive science is to facilitate knowledge discovery by assisting humans and machines in their discovery of, access to, integration and analysis of, task-appropriate scientific data and their associated algorithms and workflows. Here, we describe FAIR – a set of guiding principles to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.  The term FAIR was launched at a [Lorentz workshop](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/lc/web/2014/602/info.php3?wsid=602) in 2014, the resulting  FAIR principles were [published](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) in 2016.

### **To be Findable:**

F1. (meta)data are assigned a globally unique and eternally persistent identifier.   
F2. data are described with rich metadata.   
F3. (meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource.   
F4. metadata specify the data identifier.

### **To be Accessible:**

A1  (meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol.   
A1.1 the protocol is open, free, and universally implementable.   
A1.2 the protocol allows for an **authentication and authorization procedure**, where necessary.   
A2 metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available.

### **To be Interoperable:**

I1. (meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.   
I2. (meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles.   
I3. (meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data.

### **To be Re-usable:**

R1. (meta)data have a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes.   
R1.1. (meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license.   
R1.2. (meta)data are associated with their provenance.   
R1.3. (meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards.",,,,,jehaverlack,John Haverlack,jehaverlack,John Haverlack,Closed,Normal,Normal,Training,True,0,,"data,onboarding",[557887],0,2023-10-02 18:05:14.746930+00:00,2023-10-02 18:09:02.914241+00:00,2023-10-02 18:07:56.134240+00:00,,

> This includes the right to create value from Indigenous data in ways that are grounded in Indigenous worldviews and realise opportunities within the knowledge economy. The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance are people and purpose-oriented, reflecting the crucial role of data in advancing Indigenous innovation and self-determination. These principles complement the existing FAIR principles ([www.go-fair.org)](http://www.go-fair.org)) encouraging open and other data movements to consider both people and purpose in their advocacy and pursuits.

### Collective Benefit

*   C1 For inclusive development and innovation
*   C2 For improved governance and citizen engagement
*   C3 For equitable outcomes

### Authority to Control

*   A1 Recognizing rights and interests
*   A2 Data for governance
*   A3 Governance of data

### Responsibility

*   R1 For positive relationships
*   R2 For expanding capability and capacity
*   R3 For Indigenous languages and worldviews

### Ethics

1.  E1 For minimizing harm and maximizing benefit
2.  E2 For justice
3.  E3 For future use

> **Ownership** refers to the relationship of First Nations to their cultural knowledge, data, and information. This **principle states that a community or group owns information collectively** in the same way that an individual owns his or her personal information.

> **Control** affirms that **First Nations, their communities, and representative bodies are within their rights to seek control over all aspects of research and information management processes that impact them**. First Nations control of research can include all stages of a particular research project-from start to finish. The principle extends to the control of resources and review processes, the planning process, management of the information and so on.

> **Access** refers to the fact that **First Nations must have access to information and data about themselves and their communities** regardless of where it is held. The principle of access also refers to the right of First Nations’ communities and organizations to manage and make decisions regarding access to their collective information. This may be achieved, in practice, through standardized, formal protocols. 

> **Possession** While ownership identifies the relationship between a people and their information in principle, possession or stewardship is more concrete: it refers to the physical control of data. Possession is the mechanism by which ownership can be asserted and protected.",,,,,jehaverlack,John Haverlack,jehaverlack,John Haverlack,Closed,Normal,Normal,Training,True,0,,"data,onboarding",[],0,2023-10-02 18:08:55.033379+00:00,2023-10-02 18:31:14.293130+00:00,2023-10-02 18:31:14.297312+00:00,,

> additional actions that may affect our people and Inuit Nunaat.  
> • Involve Inuit from the beginning – With consistent, clear, and continuous communications,  
> work with us throughout the development, interpretation and implementation of all  
> agreements, policies, laws, enforcement and other activities within our homelands.

### • Recognize Indigenous Knowledge in its Own Right

> • Indigenous Knowledge must not be translated, integrated into, or validated by science –  
> Recognition, trust and respect must be given to the unique contributions of Indigenous  
> Knowledge as a way of knowing. With a clear understanding that Indigenous Knowledge  
> holds its own methodologies and objectives, one can begin to appreciate the importance  
> of not attempting to translate or integrate one source of knowledge into the other. 

> • Decisions must be informed by Inuit and our knowledge – This includes all matters  
> regarding research, management, decision- and policy-making, development, economics  
> and areas related to the governance of, within, and affecting Inuit Nunaat.
> 
> • Ensure use of Indigenous Knowledge and final products are peer-reviewed and validated  
> by Inuit – Our people hold their own unique expertise needed to evaluate approaches,  
> processes and final products. Scientific information is analyzed with a perspective uniquely  
> trained to scientists. The same is true of Indigenous Knowledge. While the two sources of  
> knowledge may complement each other in many cases, they are not the same and should  
> be appreciated for what each is able to bring to the table. Our organizations have the  
> authority to guide how to conduct the work, reviews and final products.
> 
>   
> • Ensure our knowledge is not used against us – Ensure that our knowledge provided  
> within research, management, decision- and policy-making, or other activities related to  
> governance does not subsequently harm us or our communities. Work with us to ensure  
> that our knowledge is correctly interpreted, understood and utilized to avoid its misuse 

### • Practice Good Governance 

> Address power dynamics including those embedded  
> in formal processes – Shift power dynamics to ensure  
> equitable intellectual and political space, status and  
> participation for Inuit and Indigenous Knowledge.  
> There are many points to consider in evaluating how to

> timelines to support full participation; ensuring that  
> processes for providing input align with our seasons,  
> priorities and preferred ways of communicating. Work  
> with us to further identify the best ways to address  
> power dynamics within specific settings, approaches,  
> processes and work. 

> • Respect cultural differences – Engagement activities  
> must respect and accommodate differences  
> in values, cultural norms and Inuit preferred  
> communication and decision-making styles.

> Give Back - Prioritize relationship building and  
> include reciprocity, community benefits and giving  
> back. Work to shift the norm from people coming to  
> Inuit and taking (i.e., knowledge, time, expertise) to a  
> focus on reciprocity and giving back (i.e., information  
> in accessible formats, funding, equipment, tools).  
> Work to build reciprocal relationships. This will  
> increase the impact of plans, research, decision- and  
> policy-making and mutually beneficial activities. 

### • Communication with Intent

> Ensure clear communication – Consistent, continuous and culturally appropriate

> Listen more than you speak – There is a need to listen, learn and build relationships  
> to move toward meaningful partnerships and respect. Our discussions are held with  
> a strong intent to take in what we share and move toward understanding each other.  
> Researchers, decision- and policy-makers and international fora often take the view that

1667307,162,Proposal submission expectations,"Greetings ACEP Team,  
 

Many of you may have seen the OGCA communication regarding the short-staffing at the central office. In addition, please see the expectations below at our unit-level. 

  
 

We appreciate the expert support provided by Joan and Bob at INE. Please let us know if you have any questions.

*   _Lead Time:_ Adequate lead time is always helpful, but with Sandra's departure it is critical to provide Joan and Bob with _more time_ to review pre-proposals, proposal budgets, white papers, and the like.  The earlier the better! 
*   _Assign a Point Person:_ Assign one point person to interact with the INE pre-award team for proposals that include multiple PIs and/or collaborators. It can be challenging to tease out exactly what part of a proposal needs worked on when emails come from multiple people about the same proposal. Having one person designated to interact with the proposal coordinator and line out specific action items would be helpful.
*   _Anticipate Tasks:_ Anything the PI can do on their own to move the proposal forward would be helpful (e.g., send budget notes, prepare senior project personnel listing, etc.).
*   _Provide Specifics about Personnel:_ Please provide specifics about research professional staff on projects. It is not enough to simply suggest a month's salary for a ""research professional"".  We need to know if the PI is proposing to use an RP2, RP3, or RP4 for the work.  If the PI doesn't know, then providing an example of someone with similar level skills/responsibilities would be helpful (e.g., first, last name of human). 
*   _RUSH Requests:_ Rush requests will be difficult to accommodate until the INE proposal office team is fully trained and able to operate efficiently. Please plan accordingly!

Thank you everyone,

Joan, Bob and Jennifer

I think we can combine the following with a focus on developing and testing cybersecurity services for OT networks in an OT network Sandbox.

1\. Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) Services for Operational Technology  (OT) Networks      
 

4\. Federated Identity Management for Energy Research Collaboration

5\. Operational Technology  (OT) Asset and Identity and Access Management (AM/IAM)

Additionally we probably should include services for:      
 

*   Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
*   Data Diode services -  Dayne has an ongoing dialog with Christian Hager (FEND) incorporate on this initiative.

I will also read through the following for potential alignment angles;

Proposed Appropriation Requests
-------------------------------

### Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) Services for Operational Technology  (OT) Networks

**Funding Request:** $500,000

**Topic Area:**

*   NIST Scientific & Technical Research Services Earmark Account
*   Department of Energy’s Energy Project Earmark Account

#### Summary

[Operational Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_technology) (OT) networks consist of [supervisory control and data acquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA) (SCADA) and other [industrial control systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_control_system) (ICS) which commonly represent significant cybersecurity risk do to out of date software and firmware which are difficult for a variety of reasons.   Such systems they are often placed in isolated air-gaped networks without connectivity to external networks or the internet, effectively quarantining them off from access by potential malicious actors.  However, such isolation limit the ability to automate, integrate and share data between systems and OT networks.   

Funds are requested to develop and demonstrate how to implement cost effective Zero Trust security for services in OT networks thus facilitating a more secure strategy for rural utility and off grid operational networks.

* * *

### Off Grid Emergency Communication Cyberinfrastructure

**Funding Request:** $2,000,000

**Topic Area:** 

*   FEMA Emergency Operations Center Grant Program Earmark Account

#### Summary

In today's digital world it is increasingly difficult to collaborate without access to Internet bases services for video, voice and chat communications, document and photo sharing, event scheduling and many other services.  Access to these resources is dependent on Internet access.  In remote rural areas, or areas impacted by disaster events cyber-infrastructure either does not exist, or  has been damaged by disaster events.   However, there is no technical reason why two laptops or cellphones with WiFi or Bluetooth radios cannot communicate directly with each other.   

Funds are requested to develop and demonstrate low cost Internet independent cyber-infrastructure to facilitate the easy deployment of off grid video, voice, chat, file sharing, and collaborative document sharing services in a local peer to peer network.  Alaskan rural communities represent an ideal test environment for demonstrating such services.  This project would aim to build completely self contained and readily deploy-able Off Grid Emergency Communication kits with the purpose of demonstrating how to quickly and easily deploy local communication networks without Internet access. 

* * *

### Rolling Encryption for Secure Long Term Data Archive

**Funding** Request: $3,000,000

**Topic Area**: 

*   National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC) Earmark Account
*   NIST Scientific & Technical Research Services Earmark Account

#### Summary

As technology evolves, encryption algorithms that were once considered secure may become trivial to crack in the future.  This makes it difficult to securely archive encrypted data in long term archives.  However, if it were possible to continually re-encrypt data frequently in an automated manner, then data could in principle be securely archived over long periods of time.

Funds are requested to develop and demonstrate cost effect means of providing secure scalable storage solutions for continuously encrypted secure long term data archives.

* * *

### Federated Identity Management for Energy Research Collaboration

**Funding Request:** $1,000,000

**Topic Area:**

*   NIST Scientific & Technical Research Services Earmark Account
*   Department of Energy’s Energy Project Earmark Account

#### Summary

A major source of risk and and obstacle to broader collaboration between energy researchers, government agencies and small rural utilities is having a common source for securely managing digital identities for cross organizational collaboration and access to shared resources.

Funds are requested to develop and demonstrate cost effect means of integrating federated identities for access to shared resources which facilitate secure and reliable access to shared digital assets by a wide range of collaborators.

* * *

### Operational Technology  (OT) Asset and Identity and Access Management (AM/IAM)

**Funding Request:** $1,000,000

**Topic Area:**

*   NIST Scientific & Technical Research Services Earmark Account
*   Department of Energy’s Energy Project Earmark Account

#### Summary

[Operational Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_technology) (OT) networks consist of [supervisory control and data acquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA) (SCADA) and other [industrial control systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_control_system) (ICS) which commonly represent significant cyber-security risk do to out of date software and firmware which are difficult for a variety of reasons.    A basic tenet of any cyber-security effort is that “_you cannot protect what you don't know you have, and you cannot protect what you have if you don't know who you can trust_”.   All major cybersecurity compliance frameworks require practitioners to maintain a database of information assets (aka. Asset Management) and database of personal digital identies (aka. Identity Management).

OT systems are notoriously difficult to inventory and document for cyber-security compliance purposes, and often are configured with a single shared account and password because more advance Asset and Identity management services are not available to OT networks.

Funds are requested to develop and demonstrate cost effect means of providing Asset and Identity and Access Management (AM/IAM)        
services for use in isolated Operational Technology  (OT) networks.  There by making it possible to reduce security risk in OT networks and facilitate meeting external cyber-security regulatory compliance requirements.

Nathan and John,

I'm excited about this plan we developed today with Jeremy Kasper.  I checked in with Matt Bergan at KEA, and he didn't wave us away (he gave a thumbs-up). ""Sounds like a good couple guys to bring up""      
 

The plan below attempts to stage across topics to avoid thrashing ourselves & Matt**. This is just a proposed plan - that might not be feasible based on available plane seats on a day - or your interests/availability.**      
 

Nathan: 

Join Mari and me on the flight up on Monday.  We arrive at noon.

This will give us Monday afternoon & Tuesday morning with Matt and others at KEA to talk microgrids & hydrogen ideas before EPS team comes.  _I will let you decide if you want to make this an overnight thing and fly out on Tuesday afternoon/evening or the following day, Wednesday._      
 

John: Fly up on Tuesday, either noon/evening arrival target up to you.      
 

Wednesday morning, you, Matt, and I attend the 9 AM webinar together at KEA and then can talk about the next steps on that project.  _I will let you decide if you want to make this an overnight thing and fly out on Wednesday afternoon/evening or the following day, Thursday._

Mari and I have pulled the trigger on the Hotel, and neither of us has the spare capacity to do the ATC dorms availability dance, so we recommend targeting the hotel _(you can book this through Concur at the state rate along with your flight if you submit your TA correctly)._      
 

Please submit a TA against our ARCTIC II grant against our Kotzebue Hub task:

*   T1 Kotzebue Hub 343116-68078

Thanks, and let Mari and me know if you have any questions.

**CYBERSECURITY PLAN (SEC 40126)**

Section 40216 of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) provides a framework for ensuring that the Department of Energy’s (DOE) investments in energy sector research and infrastructure are secure and resilient from cybersecurity threats, requiring all relevant IIJA-provisions to have cybersecurity plans.

In March 2023, the Secretary of Energy directed DOE's Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER) to lead cybersecurity plan coordination across DOE program offices managing provisions. Program offices implementing IIJA provisions are required to follow the CESER-led process for integrating cybersecurity planning and lifecycle management. CESER is overseeing Section 40126 implementation and has created cybersecurity plan templates that will guide funding recipients to structure a plan that meets their unique levels of risk.

Travis and John,

I am looping John into this email thread from _two years (yikes)_ ago because this is a thread I want him to be aware of as he is getting his bearings in his new role at ACEP as our Cybersecurity lead.

Having a GitHub enterprise ACEP org that uses our UA-provided identities could be an excellent tool to address some of the risks he is identifying (or will identify)  in some of our processes and protocols around code & data management.

Our campus is part of the Github Campus program, and so we get Github Enterprise Server and Github Enterprise Cloud for free as long as we agree and follow the terms of the program.  Part of those terms say we act as a single point of contact for Github and answer technical questions from our users.
> > > 
> > > The best way I can think to explain how the Github Enterprise Cloud works is to break it down into it's various scopes.  The largest scope that we manage is the Enterprise Account.  We have been given a single Github Enterprise account ([https://github.com/enterprises/university-of-alaska](https://github.com/enterprises/university-of-alaska)).  Within the Enterprise Account you have 2 roles: Enterprise Owner and Enterprise Billing Manager.  Enterprise Owners are just like Org Owners except for the Enterprise. Enterprise Owners can do things such as create/invite Organizations, and set overarching policies that apply to every Org in the Enterprise such as requiring SAML auth in addition to Github Auth or requiring 2 Factor authentication.  Currently, a subset of OIT PAWS (and Mike Brase) are the Enterprise Owners, and we require all of our members who have access to manage the Enterprise Account to have 2 Factor on their Github account.  There is also an audit log for every action related to Enterprise Management, Org Management, Team Management, Repo Management, Web Hooks, etc that we can query and export for everything under the Enterprise Account.
> > > 
> > > The next scope is Orgs.  When an Org is created under the Enterprise Account, or is invited to join the Enterprise Account,  then any member of that Org automatically becomes a member of the Enterprise.  By default, whoever creates the Org will be an Org owner,  but after the Organization is handed over to the department or team that requested it they can then manage that Org including all of it's settings (including SAML and 2 factor) and it's members.  Enterprise Owners can see every Org that is part of the Enterprise Account regardless of whether or not they are a member of that Org.  Recently, Github added the ability for Enterprise Owners to add themselves as an owner of an Enterprise Org, but this is something we only do when requested by the Org owner.

> > >

As long as they are a member of an Org that is a part of our Enterprise, they are a member of our Enterprise and can access other Enterprise resources that are scoped to Internal.  If you add SAML authentication to your Org, when an org member signs in with their Github.com account, they will then be forced to sign in via the configured IdP using SAML and link their Github account to an identity in the IdP.  This is useful if user management is critical for an Org and you want people to lose access to the Org as soon as they lose access to other services behind the IdP.  It does make other things more difficult though such as requiring users to reauthenticate to the IdP every 24 hours and authorizing SSH keys and access tokens.  More info can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/about-identity-and-access-management-with-saml-single-sign-on).
> > > 
> > > The last scope would be Repos.  As you're probably well aware, each repo can have it's own members and permissions and settings, and the visibility can be set to Public, Internal, or Private.  (Internal means other Enterprise members can see it.)  You can also invite Outside Collaborators to a repo.  Outside collaborators do not become a member of the repo or of the Enterprise, and are not subject to any SAML access restriction that might be configured on the Org.  
> > > 
> > > Github has only recommended organizations require members to create a new Github.com account specifically for the Org / Enterprise if they need to minimize risk of developers _accidentally_ pushing valuable data to another Org or Gist outside of the Enterprise.  If the Enterprise's developers are trusted, then the recommendation is to use personal Github accounts so users can get the attributions and stats that come with doing work such as commits, pull requests, and merges.   Once a user's account is no longer a member of an Enterprise Org, they will lose access to all of the Enterprise's resources, but they will still have the stats of how many commits they have done for example.  On each Org the user can also configure what email and name should be used,  so even though my Github.com personal account is Sutekidayo, on every UA Enterprise Org I use Travis Payton and [tpayton1@alaska.edu](mailto:tpayton1@alaska.edu) for attribution and notifications.  The most flexibility we have to automate user provisioning is to send Org invites via an API call to email addresses.  However, a user must still have or create a Github.com account in order to accept the invite.

If we want to use Managed Users we will need to contact sales and migrate to a new Github Enterprise Account.  Also, a Github Enterprise Account that is using Managed Users can not have any public repos. Everything must be Private or Internal.

John,

 

In our recent conversations we spoke about resiliency and BESS projects, but we did not focus on the RIR nor did we speak to the GRIP Program. We covered much ground, but I believe there was not enough time on the call.

 

Would it make sense to address this project in a focused call, specifically how we might be able to assist on a larger scale and perhaps even on the services side? We are a known quantity at Matanuska, however Homer, Seward, Golden Valley and Chugach also play a role here. We have partnerships lined up to address the NRECA ICS-REC program so this could fit nicely.

 

Looking forward to following up with both of you on this and to your feedback.

 

 

Best,

 

Christian

mponent of the project involves the implementation of a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system within the simulation. This system will be tasked with monitoring and controlling the microgrid, creating an environment that closely resembles operational technology networks in the energy sector. Integral to this setup is the simulation of Modbus communication protocols, generating data streams that mimic those found in industrial control systems.

The cybersecurity aspect of the project is of paramount importance. The simulated environment will serve as a testing ground for detecting and analyzing potential cybersecurity threats to the microgrid. This involves developing and applying strategies to identify, analyze, and mitigate attacks, thereby enhancing the security posture of such critical infrastructure.

Further, the project involves comprehensive log collection and analysis. The intern will implement mechanisms to gather and scrutinize data from various components of the microgrid system. This analysis will not only aid in understanding the normal operations of the system but will also be pivotal in identifying any anomalies that could indicate security breaches or operational malfunctions.

Simulated data generated from this project will be use to generate machine learning training data, and to evaluate various advance cybersecurity services including:

SIEM - Security Information and Event Management    
IDS - Intrusion Detection Systems    
Centralized logging and log analysis    
The project encompasses developing simulated data for cybersecurity modeling and testing. Overall, this internship offers a unique opportunity to delve into the intersecting worlds of energy systems and cybersecurity, providing hands-on experience in a field that is increasingly critical in our technology-driven world.

Field of Study / Skills:

*   Panelist input is a peer review process and provides heavy input.
*   You are writing to Program Managers and Panelist
*   Make what they are looking for is easy to find.
*   Use language of the review criteria
*   Don't assume that reviewers will know your Jargon
*   Make sure the most important things receive the most space.
*   One page project summary is the most important part.  Most panelists make up their mind here.
*   Intellectual Merritt and Broader Impacts
*   Detailed research /eval / impact plan (with a timeline)
*   Enabling support for Broader Impacts
*   Award Search  for other proposals and Broader Impacts
*   Qualifications of Key Personnel
*   50% of CISE goes to CORE
*   PEP - Project Execution Plan
*   How is it Innovative or potentially transformative?
*   How will it advance knowledge
*   Who will be intersted in these outcomes
*   What are the anticipated outcomes
*   How might these products or findings be useful on a broader scale.

This FOA aims to support the development and demonstration of technologies, tools, or systems that enable secure communications of data and control messaging between grid edge infrastructure and distribution system operators.

The grid edge is where utility service ends and customer equipment starts. Specifically, the grid edge begins at customers’ meter points and includes their own equipment, software, and controls. Examples include rooftop solar systems, electric vehicle charging stations, and energy storage solutions.

The FOA’s objective is to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of new communications solutions on utility infrastructure, and to demonstrate how legacy grid communications infrastructure and operating standards can be updated to support coordination of distributed energy resources on the distribution system. To keep the lights on for consumers, it is critical that the grid quickly responds and recovers from disruption.

*   If DOE issues the FOA, it will be posted at [**Grants.gov**](https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDIsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsInVybCI6Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cuZ3JhbnRzLmdvdj91dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9Z292ZGVsaXZlcnkiLCJidWxsZXRpbl9pZCI6IjIwMjMxMTIwLjg1OTI2MzIxIn0.CvVKXCKLN7E_iRYsk6QWpjVoXl0uzahLIFQKJqHd45E/s/2939946849/br/231268432639-l) and at [**FedConnect**](https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDMsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsInVybCI6Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cuZmVkY29ubmVjdC5uZXQ_dXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPWdvdmRlbGl2ZXJ5IiwiYnVsbGV0aW5faWQiOiIyMDIzMTEyMC44NTkyNjMyMSJ9.p-S0-TWP3YpX8kqanfQpG-stozzLdXK0VBBg-1P7mwI/s/2939946849/br/231268432639-l).

Jeremy,

Really hope you are doing well! ACEP is doing great work within the energy space. I wanted to reach out to discuss potential partnership opportunities **concerning the January 12th concept papers for the Grid Deployment Office. Topic area 2: Smart Grid Grants allows for institutions of higher education to join.** Overall grants are $1B, with typical grant at $50M. 

C3 AI is a world leading AI/ML enterprise solutions company. We are conducting work with the National Labs and DoE. C3 AI’s CTO and President Ed Abbo also recently presented to the subcommittee on energy, climate, and grid security on “The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Powering America’s Future.” We are also connecting with the Deputy Secretary of DoE and head of Grid Modernization within GDO, because of interest in our AI/ML solutions to the grid. C3 AI has years of experience related to Grid applications, utilities, and energy to include:

*   Reducing power outages and threats
*   Ensuring optimal health of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI)
*   Developing enterprise AI for digital engineering, providing digital twin capabilities
*   Employing enterprise AI for stakeholder intelligence, energy management, and monitoring ESG materiality
*   Leveraging edge computing to enable smart grid and smart city services
*   Providing cybersecurity and intelligence forecasts related to the energy
*   Enhancing advanced manufacturing processes      
     

Our logos include **Shell, ConEd, Duke Energy.**  We also have experience working with UARCs, such as work at the Applied Physics Lab at Johns Hopkins/DoD. I would love to get time with your team to see how we can partner, whether through grants or to help on current R&D. Currently, we are working with a National Lab, taking TRL 2 concepts to TRL 6, related to cybersecurity, the grid and digital engineering. Also in terms of GDO funding, **we are looking to potentially partner as we move closer to this second round of funding.** C3 AI is uniquely positioned to solve these requirements.

We’d love to set up a time to connect to see how our two teams can work together on this next round, or to see if C3 AI can help solve any problems your team is facing today. Please let me know some availabilities that work to set up a meeting. We look forward to hearing from you soon! 

Best,

Thank you for your interest in participating as an internship mentor for Summer 2024! 

  
 

To participate as a mentor in the internship program, you are required to refresh your training on the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). FERPA training is required for all UAF employees who have access to student records, supervise students, and/or have educational/instructional responsibilities.

**To participate in the internship program, your FERPA training must be completed no later than 5pm on December 8th.** 

You may access FERPA training through UAOnline and myUA. Instructions on how to access the training can be found here: [https://www.alaska.edu/studentservices/files/ferpa/FERPA.pdf](https://www.alaska.edu/studentservices/files/ferpa/FERPA.pdf)

The training only takes 10-15 minutes to complete.

**Once you have completed your training, please send your certificate/screenshot to me at** [**caellis5@alaska.edu**](mailto:caellis5@alaska.edu) **as a PDF.** Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you,

Applications are still open for the internship program until January 8. However, we already have 50+ applications that have been submitted, and every project has applicants! This would be a great time to start combing through the applications, as we will need your final top 3 interview choices by January 12.

  
 

**Now:** browse applicants-- they will continue to populate as they are submitted. I have a ""notepad"" set up on your project page so you can take notes on applicants as you read them.

**Jan 9-12:** Application closes. Decide + submit your top 3 choices for interviews on your project page.

**End of January-mid Feb:** Patty and I will be scheduling interviews.

  
 

FIRST!! Please watch this [6 minute video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gFoxWr9UPdTua1-GOXWqAVUtCxIT-1_B/view?usp=sharing) where I walk through the different pieces of the interface and the process for submitting your interview choices. It's pretty much the same as last year, but there is a new process for submitting your final selections. You can listen to it at double time and hear Chipmunk Annalise cruise through it in 3 minutes if that's all the time you have.

  
 

Then you can head over to the [interface](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invhUDAR6lmdPQyCC&inviteToken=5327c0f0a7ae9905012d88fcac6904f5d02c480783ca0f124f0667c7bb9b8197&utm_medium=email&utm_source=product_team&utm_content=transactional-alerts). If you haven't made an Airtable account before, you'll need to do that through your UAF account. Let me know if you have any questions.

This came to me from University relations. I know that the storytelling team uses [Constant Contact](https://www.constantcontact.com/), but I am not sure of other 3rd party platforms that we use at ACEP. Do you know any others?

Thanks!

Hi everyone,

We have received notice from Google and Yahoo that, effective Feb. 1, they will implement a new security technology called [DMARC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMARC) for any organization that processes more than 5,000 emails a day. The university falls into this category.

Without going into too much technical detail, this means that any third-party platform we use to send emails (things like MailChimp or Salesforce or Cision) must be DMARC compliant or we risk getting our IP addresses blacklisted, which would make mass distribution of emails impossible. 

**No later than close-of-business on Jan. 9,** please send me a list of any third-party platforms you use to send mass emails to people and the point-of-contact on your team for those platforms (so, for example, I am point-of-contact for our Merit subscription). If you use a PR or marketing agency, you should also find out whether they use a third-party platform to send emails on your behalf and, if so, list those as well. I’ll share that with the IT folks and they should be able to help with next steps.

Thanks,

MG
