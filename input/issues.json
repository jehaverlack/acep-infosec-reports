{"id":"1657618","ref":"13","subject":"ACEP Website Vulnerablity","description":"Hi Vanessa,\n\nI realize that I have not officially started yet but I was familiarizing myself with the ACEP team on the ACEP website when I discovered a minor security issue which allows anyone on the Internet to modify the ACEP directory details.  I wanted to bring this to your attention.  Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or need assistance.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe lax sharing setting on the [ACEP team database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iQU9tqWi0De4E0Da7pn4G7cADmtr0srJx9bLG4PwjWw/edit#gid=0) google spreadsheet permits anyone with the like to modify the content.  This makes it very easy for anyone to deface the ACEP website team directory with malicious or embarrassing content.  This includes modifying directory metadata and replacing people's headshot image URL links with other images.\n\n**Risks and Impacts**\n\n*   Likelihood:  Low to Moderate\n*   Impact: Moderate\n\nThe chances that someone or some botnet will find and exploit this risk is very possible, but not likely as it has not yet been exploited.  If this vulnerability is exploited the impacts to ACEP may include:\n\n*   Possible loss of directory information making it difficult to recover.\n*   Embarrassment and loss of confidence in ACEP resulting from a defaced website.\n*   Social Engineering or redirected contact info for identity theft or other malicious purposes.\n\n**Recommended Resolution**\n\n1.  Designate individual persons (@[alaska.edu](http://alaska.edu/) accounts) _**Editor**_ access to the [ACEP team database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iQU9tqWi0De4E0Da7pn4G7cADmtr0srJx9bLG4PwjWw/edit#gid=0) [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iQU9tqWi0De4E0Da7pn4G7cADmtr0srJx9bLG4PwjWw/edit#gid=0) Share option.\n2.  Change the Sharing permissions for General Access to:  _**Anyone with the link:  Viewer**_\n\nThis will give explicit permission to those who need edit permission, yet still allow anyone (and any website) on the Internet the ability to view the spreadsheet details.\n\n**Incident / Vulnerability Reporting**\n\nI assume this ACEP Website is an OU Campus website administered by OIT.\n\n*   If so then OIT may have also set up directory pages for other departments in a similar manner.\n*   I would advise forwarding this email to the UA OIT security group: [security@alaska.edu](mailto:security@alaska.edu)\n*   Or submit a ticket via: [https://www.alaska.edu/securitymatters/](https://www.alaska.edu/securitymatters/)\n\n**Technical Details**\n\n*   From the Team directory page: [https://www.uaf.edu/acep/about/our-team/index.php](https://www.uaf.edu/acep/about/our-team/index.php)\n*   One can see that the site loads the script: [https://www.uaf.edu/acep/about/our-team/directory.js](https://www.uaf.edu/acep/about/our-team/directory.js)\n*   Which contains the ACEP team database Google Spreadsheet link: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iQU9tqWi0De4E0Da7pn4G7cADmtr0srJx9bLG4PwjWw/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iQU9tqWi0De4E0Da7pn4G7cADmtr0srJx9bLG4PwjWw/edit#gid=0)\n\n![](https://media-protected.taiga.io/attachments/6/e/b/c/ef9616926a162fbc6f9f6b20056b4afd55735cc89087f7510d0b32c103fa/screenshot-from-2023-08-28-12-40-53.png?token=ZQTNUA%3AGAHMW5QJS9tSSKsA0Cv9msBYSKKPYCb85ak8Pjz7bHFqYmPu-xKiPTkh-7d6tpS9d9Zz33_MVyYfZPEW20jFQg#_taiga-refresh=issue:1957776)\n\n*   The **Share** setting for this spreadsheet permits _**Anyone with the link**_ full Edit permissions to the spreadsheet.\n\n![](https://media-protected.taiga.io/attachments/d/f/3/3/c9df488e02d0dee55f4b5f347be15d24a3f4b393ef4a9547d2fd3a23e80d/screenshot-from-2023-08-28-12-42-28.png?token=ZQTNaA%3Ay3tEHaLSGZwEIFWxrpuYcIrXSQUGYg0DkMi1EnVIJhOZDNVlwPiMD6uZoQ7AVKkZhHTZIIcYrhiv_A_MPJTouw#_taiga-refresh=issue:1957777)","sprint_id":"","sprint":"","sprint_estimated_start":"","sprint_estimated_finish":"","owner":"jehaverlack","owner_full_name":"John Haverlack","assigned_to":"jehaverlack","assigned_to_full_name":"John Haverlack","status":"Closed","severity":"Important","priority":"High","type":"Security Incident","is_closed":"True","attachments":"2","external_reference":"","tags":"acep,infosec,web","watchers":"[557887]","voters":"0","created_date":"2023-09-11 21:59:48.920362+00:00","modified_date":"2023-09-27 18:37:29.906438+00:00","finished_date":"2023-09-25 23:51:00.339734+00:00","due_date":"","due_date_reason":""}

Commitment: utilities describe their resources, need for improving their cybersecurity                       \n> posture, and commitment to participating in the ACT 1 Prize Program.\n\n*   Submission Due 2023-11-29\n*   Describe need, goals, service territory, and demonstrate commitment\n*   Prize Awarded to ~55 winners ~March 2024\n*   Award: $50k / 60 hours Technical Assistance\n\n> Funding is provided to winners for work that has already been performed. Once a prize is awarded, winners determine how best to use the funds, with no further commitments.\n\n#### 1.1 Goal\n\n> The goal of the Commitment Phase is to begin identifying the cybersecurity improvements your utility                 \n> would like to accomplish and gaining your leadership’s commitment to making improvements. In the                 \n> Commitment Phase, you will describe why your utility should qualify as a limited cybersecurity resources                 \n> utility if you are competing in the LIMITED CYBERSECURITY RESOURCES track. Utilities in both tracks                 \n> must describe the utility’s current cybersecurity maturity level and demonstrate in your submission                 \n> package that your utility and its staff have the capacity to work with TA providers. Utilities will need to                 \n> provide a letter of support from their authorizing official (CEO, general manager, or governing board)                 \n> supporting staff resources and time to this effort and affirming the utility’s commitment to fully                 \n> participate. The RMUC Program recognizes the economic challenges many rural communities face, and                 \n> competitors will also be asked to describe their utility service territory, the communities they serve, and                 \n> the work they do to support disadvantaged communities in their service territory.                 \n> Submission packages for the Commitment Prize will be evaluated based on the following criteria (See                 \n> Section 1.4 for more information):\n> \n> *   Criterion 1: **Utility Need and Cybersecurity Maturity Level**\n> *   Criterion 2: **Initial Goals, Expected Outcomes, and Impacts on Utility**\n> *   Criterion 3: **Commitment to Implement Cybersecurity Improvements and Capacity to Utilize TA**\n> *   Criterion 4: **Description of Service Territory and Community Benefits**.\n> \n> Priority will be given to utilities that have limited cybersecurity resources and cybersecurity capabilities,                 \n> have a commitment and capacity to work with TA providers, have strong leadership support, and/or serve                 \n> a high proportion of low-income and disadvantaged communities.\n\n#### 1.3 What to Submit for the Commitment Prize\n\n> To apply for a Commitment Prize, the utility must:\n> \n> • **Have a staff member attend two required ACT 1 Prize Program workshops**\n> \n> • Upload a submission package that includes all the items listed below:\n> \n> 1\\. **Cover page and narrative**\n> \n> 2\\. **Letter of support from your organization’s authorizing official (e.g., CEO, general manager, board of directors, etc.)**\n> \n> 3\\. **Utility Profile Form (use form provided) Page 13 of 45**\n> \n> 4\\. **RMUC Utility Service Territory Report (use Report provided)**\n> \n> 5\\. **TA Request Form (use form provided)**\n> \n> 6\\. **Mandatory ACT 1 Prize virtual workshops attendance confirmation.**\n\n#### ACT 1 prize winners will: \n\n*   Develop network architectures of their digital systems to identify and prioritize where interventions might be most effective\n*   Assess current cybersecurity technical stacks for gaps, duplication of functions, and opportunities to fully utilize existing capabilities\n*   Create cybersecurity plans and roadmaps to improve their cybersecurity posture\n*   Identify solutions that can be operated and maintained by existing staff and budgets\n*   Develop budgets, cost projections, and purchasing plans to minimize third-party risks when selecting solutions\n*   Implement solutions\n*   Develop and implement processes to ensure solutions are installed securely and perform as intended.\n\n> The ACT 1 Prize Program will prioritize utilities eligible to participate in the RMUC Program that have                       \n> limited cybersecurity resources or serve military installations. Utilities are strongly encouraged to apply if                       \n> they: (1) have limited economic and staff resources; (2) have limited access to cybersecurity training, TA,                       \n> and support services; and (3) have a low cybersecurity maturity level.  Utilities that serve military                       \n> installations are also strongly encouraged to apply.\n\nSuccessful utilities in the ACT 1 Prize Program competition will **identify cybersecurity risks**, **identify solutions** that **reduce or eliminate** those risks, and **implement selected solutions**. Work completed by these utilities should accomplish one or more of the following goals: \n\n*   A) Increase a utility’s ability to identify cybersecurity threats within their information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) systems Page 8 of 45\n*   B) Improve a utility’s ability to protect against cybersecurity threats\n*   C) Improve a utility’s ability to detect cybersecurity events and incidents soon after they occur\n*   D) Prepare a utility to respond to and mitigate damage from a cybersecurity incident rapidly and effectively\n*   E) Recover from a cybersecurity incident and identify and implement process improvements.\n\n> Phase 1: Commitment. **Competitors will describe their utility’s need for assistance, the communities they serve**, and their **commitment to improving their utility’s cybersecurity posture**. The **50 limited cybersecurity resource** utilities and 5 utilities serving military installations that most successfully describe and demonstrate their cybersecurity needs, capacity to work with TA providers, and leadership commitment to the Program will be selected to win a Commitment Prize.

As a PI of the proposal I really hope that this instrument will help advance all your research activities. I believe this instrumentation will be a major driver for the University of Alaska (UA) Statewide System to pursue research activities that are really critical for Alaska's wellbeing, especially those which are data-intensive and/or computationally challenging. I also hope this It will play a major role in improving the UA system's technology education infrastructure contributing significantly towards building the state's future hitech workforce.\n\nMy sincere THANKS to the INE proposal office, OGCA, tam and the proposal offices of each collaborator for preparing the budget, budget-justification, review work, and other activities that made the submission process meticulously correct and smooth. A very special THANK to Sandra Boatwright who is retired now but led the entire effort even on her last day at work when NSF asked for the updated CPOSs from all the Co-PIs and Senior Personnel.\n\nMy sincere thanks to Kelvin Chu and his TIG team for reviewing my proposal before submission and suggesting the modifications that ended up in a successful award.\n\nFinally, I would also like to thank all the Deans, Directors, and VCR for their support starting from white paper competition, its selection, and providing all the prerequisites including the research environments, labs, contacts, letters of support, and other administrative support. \n\nIn the end, as a second year Assistant Professor at UAF (about to submit my last year documents in Faculty 180 😆 ), I would like to express my sincere THANKS to you all for supporting me as a PI and contributing to the proposal. I really appreciate all your efforts. IT REALLY MEANS A LOT.\n\nI will update the project status from time to time and will organize meetings with you to decide the next steps. \n\nThanks and Regards,\nArghya Kusum Das, \n\n\n---------- Forwarded message ---------\nFrom: <lfarrior@nsf.gov>\nDate: Mon, Sep 11, 2023 at 10:31 AM\nSubject: NSF Award Notice for Award ID 2320196 - Amendment ID 000\nTo: <uaf-ogca@alaska.edu>\nCC: <aabo@nsf.gov>, <akdas@alaska.edu>, <alsuarez@nsf.gov>, <andjohns@nsf.gov>, <avirella@nsf.gov>, <cnanders@nsf.gov>, <djwhite@nsf.gov>, <fhuettmann@alaska.edu>, <fwitmer@alaska.edu>, <gmarshal@nsf.gov>, <jrglass@alaska.edu>, <loforbes@alaska.edu>, <twhitmer@nsf.gov>\n\n\nNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION\nAward Notice\nAward Number (FAIN): 2320196\nManaging Division Abbreviation: OAC\tAmendment Number: 000\nRECIPIENT INFORMATION\nRecipient (Legal Business Name): UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA FAIRBANKS\nRecipient Address: 2145 N.

{"id":"1662720","ref":"97","subject":"Github TOS","description":"Has ACEP Reviewed Github TOS for Federal Agencies?\n\n**Terms of Service**  \n \n\nFrom a 2023-02-13 email I sent to CFOS students\n\n> Specifically for CFOS,  \n> A few points to consider before using [github.com](http://github.com/) for University related repositories:\n> \n> 1.  Do not publish content on  public repositories unless you have prior permission from the [UA Office of Intellectual Property](https://www.uaf.edu/oipc/) to do so.\n> 2.  READ the [Terms of service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) to make sure your project is in compliance.  There are many legal things to consider.\n> 3.  READ the additional [ToS for U.S. Federal Government](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) users if your project is federally funded.\n> 4.  Be careful when creating non-UA accounts on external vendor sites ([github.com](http://github.com/))  It maybe more advisable to contact OIT about using UA's Github server:   [https://github.alaska.edu/](https://github.alaska.edu/)   (This also mostly addresses business continuity, ToS and other security concerns.)\n> \n>   \n> Git is a powerful tool for managing code bases.  I highly recommend using Git.    \n> GitHub is a private company and care must be taken before posting code to it for both legal and cybersecurity reasons.     \n> GitHub is not equivalent to Git.  Oftentimes people confuse them.  \n> Also for the brave, you can host you one git server with [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/)\n\n**UA Github**\n\nWe have [github.alaska.edu](http://github.alaska.edu/) linked to our @[alaska.edu](http://alaska.edu/) accounts.   However this resource is for UA use only and not for publishing or collaborating outside of UA.  While this service is still online I've heard it will be going away but don't have a hard ETA on this.  I used to use this to internally host SKQ repos: [https://github.alaska.edu/skq](https://github.alaska.edu/skq)  However have move all of those repositories over to [https://ci.sikuliaq.alaska.edu/git/skqit](https://ci.sikuliaq.alaska.edu/git/skqit)  (Self hosted) to avoid getting cut off when [github.alaska.edu](http://github.alaska.edu/) goes away.\n\nI've reached out to Liam Forbes (RCS) to see if he knows more about the status of this and what is the prefered UAF Github resource.  Standing by for a response.\n\n**Office of Intellectual Property**\n\nPer a contract letter I recently signed:\n\n> Ownership of intellectual property you may produce is governed by University [Regulation 10.07.05](https://www.alaska.edu/bor/policy-regulations/chapter-10-07-research-scholarship-creative-activity.php#P10.07.050) or, if  \n> applicable, the terms of a collective bargaining agreement.\n\nMy interpretation of this has been that I'm not at liberty to share code or works that UAF paid me to produce with those outside of UAF without prior permission.\n\nThere may be some exceptions if we receive grant funding for the purposes of collaboration with persons outside of UAF. \n\nI would advise contacting the UAF Office of Intellectual Property and Commercialization [https://www.uaf.edu/oipc/](https://www.uaf.edu/oipc/) to get that permission.  \n \n\nFYI I did work with UAF OIPC to license the ITAM project so that I could share it with others in the fleet.  It was a fairly easy process of proposing and ISC license and getting written permission to publish this codebase.\n\n*   [https://www.sikuliaq.alaska.edu/git/skq/skq-it-am](https://www.sikuliaq.alaska.edu/git/skq/skq-it-am)\n\n**If you get their permission in writing then it clear sailing to share code and works from there on.**\n\n**Open Source License**\n\nChoice of license is important.  I strongly recommend that any work use a permissive license such as:\n\n*   [MIT](https://opensource.org/license/MIT/)\n*   [BSD 3 Clause](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause/)\n*   [ISC](https://opensource.org/license/isc-license-txt/)\n\nI advise against restrictive or wordy licenses such at GPL or Apache.","sprint_id":"","sprint":"","sprint_estimated_start":"","sprint_estimated_finish":"","owner":"jehaverlack","owner_full_name":"John Haverlack","assigned_to":"jehaverlack","assigned_to_full_name":"John Haverlack","status":"New","severity":"Normal","priority":"Normal","type":"Administrative","is_closed":"False","attachments":"0","external_reference":"","tags":"acep,data,legal","watchers":"[]","voters":"0","created_date":"2023-09-21 18:08:10.752961+00:00","modified_date":"2023-09-27 18:39:25.208115+00:00","finished_date":"","due_date":"","due_date_reason":""}

OT encompasses a                  \n> broad range of programmable systems and devices that interact with the physical environment                  \n> (or manage devices that interact with the physical environment). These systems and devices                  \n> detect or cause a direct change through the monitoring and/or control of devices, processes, and                  \n> events. Examples include industrial control systems, building automation systems, transportation                  \n> systems, physical access control systems, physical environment monitoring systems, and                  \n> physical environment measurement systems. The document provides an overview of OT and                  \n> typical system topologies, identifies common threats and vulnerabilities to these systems, and                  \n> provides recommended security countermeasures to mitigate the associated risks\n\n*   Additional alignment with other OT security standards and guidelines, including the Cybersecurity Framework\n*   New tailoring guidance for NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5 security controls\n*   An OT overlay for NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5 security controls that provides tailored security control baselines for low-, moderate-, and high-impact OT systems\n\n> Initially, OT had little resemblance to traditional information technology (IT) systems because                \n> OT systems were isolated, ran proprietary control protocols, and used specialized hardware and                \n> software. As OT systems adopt IT solutions to enable corporate business systems connectivity                \n> and remote access capabilities and are designed and implemented using industry-standard                \n> computers, operating systems (OSs), and network protocols, they have begun to resemble IT                \n> systems. This integration supports new IT capabilities, but it provides significantly less isolation                \n> for OT from the outside world than predecessor systems, creating a greater need to secure OT                \n> systems. The increasing use of wireless networking places OT implementations at greater risk                \n> from adversaries who are in relatively close physical proximity but do not have direct physical                \n> access to the equipment. While security solutions have been designed to deal with these issues in                \n> typical IT systems, special precautions must be taken when introducing these same solutions to                \n> OT environments. In some cases, new security solutions that are tailored to the OT environment                \n> are needed.\n> \n> OT cybersecurity programs should always be part of broader OT safety and reliability programs                \n> at both industrial sites and enterprise cybersecurity programs because cybersecurity is essential                \n> to the safe and reliable operation of modern industrial processes.\n> \n> Possible incidents that an OT system may face include:                \n> •Blocked or delayed flow of information through OT networks, which could disrupt OT                \n> operation, including loss of view and loss of control                \n> •Unauthorized changes to instructions, commands, or alarm thresholds that could damage,                \n> disable, or shut down equipment, create environmental impacts, and/or endanger human                \n> life                \n> •Inaccurate information sent to system operators, either to disguise unauthorized changes                \n> or to cause operators to initiate inappropriate actions that could have various negative                \n> effects                \n> •Modified OT software or configuration settings or OT software infected with malware,                \n> which could have various negative effects                \n> •Interference with the operation of equipment protection systems, which could endanger                \n> costly and difficult-to-replace equipment                \n> •Interference with the operation of safety systems, which could endanger human life\n> \n> **Major security objectives for an OT implementation should include the following:**\n> \n> *   Restrict logical access to the OT network, network activity, and systems.\n> *   Restrict physical access to the OT network and devices.\n> *   Protect individual OT components from exploitation.\n> *   Restrict unauthorized modification of data.\n> *   Detect security events and incidents.\n> *   Maintain functionality during adverse conditions.\n> *   Restore and recover the system after an incident.\n> \n> At a minimum, the cybersecurity team should                \n> consist of a member of the organization’s IT staff, a control engineer, a control system operator,                \n> a network and system security expert, a member of the management staff, and a member of the                \n> physical security department.\n> \n> The cybersecurity team                \n> should coordinate closely with site management (e.g., facility superintendent) and the company’s                \n> Chief Information Officer (CIO) or Chief Security Officer (CSO), who – along with the Chief                \n> Executive Officer (CEO) or Chief Operating Officer (COO) – accepts complete responsibility                \n> and accountability for the cybersecurity of the OT system and for any safety incidents, reliability                \n> incidents, or equipment damage caused directly or indirectly by cyber incidents.\n> \n> **In a typical OT system, a defense-in-depth strategy includes:**                \n> •Developing security policies, procedures, training, and educational material that apply                \n> specifically to the OT system                \n> •Considering OT security policies and procedures based on the [National Terrorism](https://www.dhs.gov/national-terrorism-advisory-system)                \n> [Advisory System](https://www.dhs.gov/national-terrorism-advisory-system) and deploying increasingly heightened security postures as the Threat                \n> Level increases                \n> •Addressing security throughout the life cycle of the OT system, including architecture                \n> design, procurement, installation, operations, maintenance, and decommissioning\n> \n> •Implementing a network topology for the OT system that has multiple layers, with the                \n> most critical communications occurring in the most secure and reliable layer                \n> •**Providing logical separation between the corporate and OT networks (e.g., stateful**                \n> **inspection firewalls between the networks, unidirectional gateways)**                \n> •Considering where physical separation may be required as opposed to logical separation                \n> •Employing a DMZ network architecture (e.g., prevent direct traffic between the corporate                \n> and OT networks)                \n> •**Using multi-factor authentication for remote access to the OT system**                \n> •Ensuring that critical components are redundant and are on redundant networks                \n> •Designing critical systems for graceful degradation (fault tolerant) to prevent catastrophic                \n> cascading events                \n> •**Disabling unused ports and services on OT devices after testing to ensure that this will**                \n> **not impact OT operation**                \n> •Restricting physical access to the OT network and devices                \n> •**Restricting OT user privileges to only those that are required to perform each user’s**                \n> **function (e.g., establishing role-based access control, configuring each role based on the**                \n> **principle of least privilege)**                \n> •**Using separate authentication mechanisms and credentials for users of the OT network**                \n> **and the corporate network (i.e., OT network accounts do not use corporate network user**                \n> **accounts)**                \n> •**Using modern technology, such as smart cards for user authentication**                \n> •**Implementing security controls (e.g., intrusion detection software, antivirus software, file**                \n> **integrity checking software) where technically feasible to prevent, deter, detect, and**                \n> **mitigate the introduction, exposure, and propagation of malicious software to, within, and**                \n> **from the OT system**                \n> •**Applying security techniques, such as encryption and/or cryptographic hashes, to OT data**                \n> **storage and communications where appropriate**                \n> •**Expeditiously deploying security patches after testing all patches under field conditions**                \n> **on a test system, if possible, before installation on the OT system**                \n> •**Tracking and monitoring audit trails on critical areas of the OT system**                \n> •Employing reliable and secure network protocols and services where feasible\n\n### 2 OT Overview\n\n> The system can be configured in one of three ways:              \n> •Open loop: The output is controlled by established settings.              \n> •Closed loop: The output affects the input in such a way as to maintain the desired control              \n> objective.              \n> •Manual mode: The system is completely controlled by humans.\n> \n> The introduction of IT capabilities into physical systems presents             \n> emergent behavior with security implications.\n\n[https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors)\n\n> *   Energy Sector\n> *   Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste Sector\n> *   Transportation Systems Sector\n> \n> For example, both the electrical power transmission and distribution grid industries use             \n> geographically distributed SCADA control technology to operate highly interconnected and             \n> dynamic systems that consist of thousands of public and private utilities and rural cooperatives             \n> for supplying electricity to end users. Some SCADA systems monitor and control electricity             \n> distribution by collecting data from and issuing commands to geographically remote field control             \n> stations from a centralized location. SCADA systems are also used to monitor and control water,             \n> oil, and natural gas distribution, including pipelines, ships, trucks, rail systems, and wastewater             \n> collection systems.\n> \n> Electric power is often thought to be one of the most prevalent sources of disruptions of             \n> interdependent critical infrastructures.\n> \n> **Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)** systems are used to control dispersed assets             \n> for which centralized data acquisition is as important as control \\[Bailey\\]\\[Boyer\\]. These systems             \n> are used in distribution systems, such as water distribution and wastewater collection systems, oil             \n> and natural gas pipelines, electrical utility transmission and distribution systems, and rail and             \n> other public transportation systems. SCADA systems integrate data acquisition systems with data             \n> transmission systems and HMI software to provide a centralized monitoring and control system             \n> for numerous process inputs and outputs.\n> \n> The various topologies used are shown in Fig. 3, including point-to-point, series, series-star, and multi-drop \\[AGA12\\].\n> \n> A **distributed control system (DCS)** is used to control production systems within the same             \n> geographic location for industries such as oil refineries, water and wastewater treatment, electric             \n> power generation, chemical manufacturing, automotive production, and pharmaceutical             \n> processing. These systems are usually process control or discrete part control systems.\n> \n> The **Industrial Internet of Things** (IIoT) consists of sensors, instruments, machines, and other            \n> devices that are networked together and use internet connectivity to enhance industrial and            \n> manufacturing business processes and applications \\[Berge\\]. As IT and OT systems continue to            \n> converge and become even more interconnected, the control of physical processes remains a            \n> relatively unique and critical concept of OT.\n> \n> The Industry IoT Consortium proposes a three-tier system architecture model for representing            \n> IIoT systems \\[IIRA19\\]: the **edge tier, platform tier, and enterprise tier**\n\n![](https://media-protected.taiga.io/attachments/8/0/9/5/058f7b5fd3d1aa42cfeb492cf799f5bfa294d4a0c2bee69291af998d480a/screenshot-from-2023-10-05-13-59-10.png?token=ZUlQSw%3ACHZNzfirzPCjq5-z3wwPByEVqC7yQJyk9itmq_HseiWlnsDBTe2FqJilIbH-zJBojB-PlcoXR0XPQny11HxP6g#_taiga-refresh=issue:1982802)\n\n> The IIoT system architecture is fully distributed and can support a wide range of interactions and           \n> communication paradigms, including:           \n> •Peer-to-peer networking (e.g., security cameras communicating about identified objects)           \n> •Edge-device collaboration (e.g., wind turbines in remote locations)           \n> •Distributed queries across data stored in devices, in the cloud, and anywhere in between           \n> •Distributed data management that defines where and what data is to be stored and for           \n> how long           \n> •Data governance, including quality, discovery, usability, privacy, and security\n\n**Some special considerations when securing OT include:**\n\n> *   Timeliness and performance requirements. - Low Latency prioritized over bandwidth capacity\n> *   Availability requirements.\n> *   Risk management requirements. - In a typical IT system, primary concerns include data           \n>     confidentiality and integrity. For OT, primary concerns include safety, fault tolerance to           \n>     prevent the loss of life or endangerment of public health or confidence, regulatory           \n>     compliance, loss of equipment, loss of intellectual property, or lost or damaged products.\n> *   Physical effects.\n> *   System operation. - Control networks are typically managed by control engineers rather than IT personnel\n> *   Resource constraints. - OT and their real-time operating systems (RTOSs) are often           \n>     resource-constrained systems that do not include typical contemporary IT security           \n>     capabilities. Legacy systems often lack resources that are common on modern IT           \n>     systems. Many systems may also lack desired features, including encryption capabilities,           \n>     error logging, and password protection. **Indiscriminate use of IT security practices in OT**           \n>     **may cause availability and timing disruptions.** There may not be computing resources           \n>     available on OT components to retrofit these systems with current security capabilities.           \n>     Adding resources or features may not be possible.\n> *   Communications. - Communication protocols and media used by OT environments for           \n>     field device control and intra-processor communication are typically different from IT           \n>     environments and may be proprietary.\n> *   Change management. - Change management is paramount to maintaining the integrity of           \n>     both IT and OT systems.

Cybersecurity is a business responsibility shared by all           \n> members of the organization, especially by its leaders and IT and OT teams.\n> \n> As OT systems are increasingly being connected to IT networks, relying on traditional measures (e.g.,           \n> air gaps) is not enough to protect such systems from cyber attacks. Therefore, security measures           \n> tailored to the OT system are required to protect the organization.\n> \n> The OT cybersecurity strategy leverages the organization-wide risk           \n> management strategy – including organization-defined risk tolerance, threats, assumptions,           \n> constraints, priorities, and trade-offs – to further tailor the strategy to apply to the OT           \n> cybersecurity program.\n> \n> The OT cybersecurity strategy:           \n> •Refines and supplements guidance from the organization-wide risk management strategy           \n> to address OT-specific constraints and requirements           \n> •Identifies the OT cybersecurity team and personnel           \n> •Addresses the OT cybersecurity operation model (e.g., insource, outsource, and/or use           \n> managed security services)           \n> •Outlines the appropriate cybersecurity architecture for the various OT sites within the OT           \n> program           \n> •Defines OT-specific cybersecurity training and awareness \n> \n> **Establish a Cybersecurity Awareness Training Program for the OT**           \n> **Environment**           \n> Organizations should ensure that all personnel who interact with OT systems – including           \n> employees, contractors, consultants, and vendors – receive cybersecurity training that is relevant           \n> to the OT environment in addition to general IT cybersecurity awareness training. This training           \n> is used to inform personnel of basic cybersecurity principles, teach them about their potential           \n> impacts on security and safety, and outline the steps that they need to follow when interacting           \n> with OT systems.

For example, NERC Standard CIP-005 (see Appendix D.1.9)     \n> provides cybersecurity architecture requirements for bulk electric systems. Similar requirements     \n> and guidance exist for other regulated industries.\n\n**Environmental Considerations**\n\n**Field I/O (Purdue Level 0) Security Considerations**\n\n### 6 Applying the Cybersecurity Framework to OT\n\n> The CSF Functions guide the following actions:\n> \n> *   Identify (ID) – Develop an organizational     \n>     understanding to manage cybersecurity risk to     \n>     systems, people, assets, data, and capabilities.\n> *   Protect (PR) – Develop and implement appropriate     \n>     safeguards to ensure delivery of critical services.\n> *   Detect (DE) – Develop and implement appropriate     \n>     activities to identify the occurrence of the     \n>     cybersecurity event.\n> *   Respond (RS) – Develop and implement     \n>     appropriate activities to take action regarding a     \n>     detected cybersecurity incident.\n> *   Recover (RC) – Develop and implement     \n>     appropriate activities to maintain plans for     \n>     resilience and to restore any capabilities or services     \n>     that were impaired due to a cybersecurity incident.\n\n#### Asset Management (ID.AM)\n\n> The ability for organizations to properly and consistently identify and manage data, personnel,     \n> devices, systems, and facilities based on their relative importance provides a foundational     \n> capability to support an organizational cybersecurity program. Additionally, updating inventory     \n> information when components are added, removed, or changed (e.g., patched, new firmware     \n> installed, component swapped during maintenance) helps organizations accurately manage their     \n> overall environmental risks. Organizations should consider including the following to support     \n> their asset **management capability:**     \n> **•Unique** identifiers to differentiate and track assets     \n> •**Hardware inventory management** to track computing and network devices within the     \n> environment, including device details and location. Device details may include vendor,     \n> model, serial number, purchase information, and manufacturing/build information (e.g.,     \n> provenance information).     \n> •**Software and firmware inventory** management to track the software and firmware     \n> installed with the OT components, including version numbers, location information, and     \n> software bill of materials (SBOM)     \n> •**Vendor information** to establish a repository of vendor information, points of contact,     \n> warranty information, locations of recall, and update information     \n> •**Documented roles and responsibilities** to identify specific individuals, teams, or     \n> organization groups who represent the asset owner and those with operation,     \n> maintenance, and cybersecurity roles and responsibilities\n\nSupplemental guidance for ID.AM can be found in the following documents:     \n•[NIST SP 1800-5, IT Asset Management](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1800-5.pdf)     \n•[NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf)     \n[Organizations](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf)\n\nMapping Data Flows (ID.AM-3)\n\nNetwork Architecture Documentation (Supports the Outcome of    \nID.AM)\n\nGovernance (ID.GV)\n\n#### Identity Management and Access Control (PR.AC)\n\n> Identity Management and Access Control (PR.AC) identifies outcomes around establishing and    \n> managing the identification mechanisms and credentials for users, devices, and services. Identity    \n> management supports the cybersecurity principle of positively and uniquely identifying and    \n> authorizing a person, process, or device before granting physical or logical access to resources    \n> such as the system, information, or location being protected. Access controls represent the    \n> policies, processes, and technologies for specifying the use of system resources by only    \n> authorized users, programs, processes, or other systems.

Clean Energy Cybersecurity Accelerator Initiative   \nThis initiative is led by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Renewable   \nEnergy Laboratory (NREL) and brings together federal infrastructure and expertise, asset owners   \nin the energy sector, and technology innovators in a unified effort to catalyze the development of   \nnew cybersecurity solutions for the Nation’s future clean energy grid.   \nThe Cybersecurity Accelerator program offers a world-class facility for asset owners of all sizes   \nand types to work jointly to develop and deploy renewable, modern, and secure grid technologies   \nthat are cost competitive. These innovative technologies will also advance the state of the   \npractice in demonstrating “security by design,” thus ensuring that cybersecurity is built into   \nrenewable technologies and architectures at the start of the design and development process, not   \nbolted on after deployment.   \n[https://www.energy.gov/ceser/department-energy-clean-energy-accelerator-initiative](https://www.energy.gov/ceser/department-energy-clean-energy-accelerator-initiative)\n\nD.2.2. Cybersecurity for Energy Delivery Systems (CEDS) R&D Program   \nThe Department of Energy (DOE) Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response   \n(CESER) Office designed the CEDS R&D program in 2010 to develop cybersecurity solutions   \nfor energy delivery systems through a focused research and development effort. Since then, DOE   \nCESER has invested more than $240 million with industry partners to make advances in   \ncybersecurity capabilities for energy delivery systems. These research partnerships are helping to   \ndetect, prevent, and mitigate the consequences of a cyber incident for current and future energy   \ndelivery systems.\n\n[https://www.energy.gov/ceser/cybersecurity-research-development-and-demonstration-rdd-energy-delivery-systems](https://www.energy.gov/ceser/cybersecurity-research-development-and-demonstration-rdd-energy-delivery-systems)\n\nD.2.3. Cybersecurity for the Operational Technology Environment (CyOTE)   \nDOE CESER has partnered with the Idaho National Laboratory and energy companies on a   \nresearch initiative to enhance energy-sector threat detection of anomalous behavior that   \npotentially indicates malicious cyber activity in OT networks.   \n[https://inl.gov/cyote/](https://inl.gov/cyote/)\n\nD.2.4. Cybersecurity Risk Information Sharing Program (CRISP)   \nThe Cybersecurity Risk Information Sharing Program (CRISP) is a public-private partnership   \nthat is co-funded by DOE and industry and managed by the Electricity Information Sharing and   \nAnalysis Center (E-ISAC) at NERC. The purpose of CRISP is to collaborate with energy-sector   \npartners to facilitate the timely bidirectional sharing of unclassified and classified threat   \ninformation and to develop situational awareness tools that enhance the sector’s ability to   \nidentify, prioritize, and coordinate the protection of critical infrastructure and key resources.   \nCRISP leverages DOE’s advanced sensors, threat analysis techniques, and expertise to better   \ninform the energy sector of high-level cyber risks. This information is shared with voluntary   \nutility participants who collectively deliver more than 80 % of the Nation’s electricity. The   \nPacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) plays a lead role at CRISP.   \n[https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2021-12/CRISP%20Fact%20Sheet\\_508.pdf](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2021-12/CRISP%20Fact%20Sheet_508.pdf)\n\nD.5.4.

Here, we describe FAIR – a set of guiding principles to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.  The term FAIR was launched at a [Lorentz workshop](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/lc/web/2014/602/info.php3?wsid=602) in 2014, the resulting  FAIR principles were [published](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) in 2016.\n\n### **To be Findable:**\n\nF1. (meta)data are assigned a globally unique and eternally persistent identifier.   \nF2. data are described with rich metadata.   \nF3. (meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource.   \nF4. metadata specify the data identifier.\n\n### **To be Accessible:**\n\nA1  (meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol.   \nA1.1 the protocol is open, free, and universally implementable.   \nA1.2 the protocol allows for an **authentication and authorization procedure**, where necessary.   \nA2 metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available.\n\n### **To be Interoperable:**\n\nI1. (meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.   \nI2. (meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles.   \nI3. (meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data.\n\n### **To be Re-usable:**\n\nR1. (meta)data have a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes.   \nR1.1. (meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license.   \nR1.2. (meta)data are associated with their provenance.   \nR1.3. (meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards.","sprint_id":"","sprint":"","sprint_estimated_start":"","sprint_estimated_finish":"","owner":"jehaverlack","owner_full_name":"John Haverlack","assigned_to":"jehaverlack","assigned_to_full_name":"John Haverlack","status":"Closed","severity":"Normal","priority":"Normal","type":"Training","is_closed":"True","attachments":"0","external_reference":"","tags":"data,onboarding","watchers":"[557887]","voters":"0","created_date":"2023-10-02 18:05:14.746930+00:00","modified_date":"2023-10-02 18:09:02.914241+00:00","finished_date":"2023-10-02 18:07:56.134240+00:00","due_date":"","due_date_reason":""}

This **principle states that a community or group owns information collectively** in the same way that an individual owns his or her personal information.\n\n> **Control** affirms that **First Nations, their communities, and representative bodies are within their rights to seek control over all aspects of research and information management processes that impact them**. First Nations control of research can include all stages of a particular research project-from start to finish. The principle extends to the control of resources and review processes, the planning process, management of the information and so on.\n\n> **Access** refers to the fact that **First Nations must have access to information and data about themselves and their communities** regardless of where it is held. The principle of access also refers to the right of First Nations’ communities and organizations to manage and make decisions regarding access to their collective information. This may be achieved, in practice, through standardized, formal protocols. \n\n> **Possession** While ownership identifies the relationship between a people and their information in principle, possession or stewardship is more concrete: it refers to the physical control of data. Possession is the mechanism by which ownership can be asserted and protected.","sprint_id":"","sprint":"","sprint_estimated_start":"","sprint_estimated_finish":"","owner":"jehaverlack","owner_full_name":"John Haverlack","assigned_to":"jehaverlack","assigned_to_full_name":"John Haverlack","status":"Closed","severity":"Normal","priority":"Normal","type":"Training","is_closed":"True","attachments":"0","external_reference":"","tags":"data,onboarding","watchers":"[]","voters":"0","created_date":"2023-10-02 18:08:55.033379+00:00","modified_date":"2023-10-02 18:31:14.293130+00:00","finished_date":"2023-10-02 18:31:14.297312+00:00","due_date":"","due_date_reason":""}

Circumpolar Inuit Protocols for Equitable and Ethical Engagement. This report and associated materials can be downloaded for free at the Inuit Circumpolar Council websites: iccalaska.org (Alaska), inuitcircumpolar.com (Canada), inuit.org (Greenland) and iccchukotka.ru (Chukotka).\n\nThere are Eight protocols: \n\n### • ‘Nothing About Us Without Us’ – Always Engage with Inuit\n\n> Implement UNDRIP – Be familiar with and implement the provisions of the UNDRIP  \n> within all aspects of your work. Collaborating with Inuit partners, you can work together  \n> to identify the best pathways to ensure that you are implementing UNDRIP. This directive  \n> applies to all phases and types of work – research, decision- and policy-making, and any  \n> additional actions that may affect our people and Inuit Nunaat.  \n> • Involve Inuit from the beginning – With consistent, clear, and continuous communications,  \n> work with us throughout the development, interpretation and implementation of all  \n> agreements, policies, laws, enforcement and other activities within our homelands.  \n> • Prioritize Inuit rights – Our concerns and our voices must be heard, and dialogue should  \n> be a substantive exchange of ideas, knowledge, and views between equally engaged  \n> partners. Ensure equitable weight is given to Inuit perspectives, approaches, ideas,  \n> decisions, and knowledge.  \n> • Approach Inuit engagement through ‘Free, Prior, and Informed Consent’ – Working  \n> within Inuit Nunaat, with Inuit, and Indigenous Knowledge is always subject to this right  \n> and principle, which includes the ability to say ‘yes’, ‘yes with conditions’, and ‘no’. It is  \n> important to note that silence does not mean agreement or yes.  \n> • Seek Inuit authority and guidance – Engage with us before initiating any proposals,  \n> research, or other work. To engage with us, become familiar with our institutions at  \n> local, regional, national, or international levels. Inuit-driven publications can aid in  \n> understanding Inuit positions on different points. For example, A Circumpolar Inuit  \n> Declaration on Sovereignty in the Arctic offers important insights and direction about Inuit  \n> as active partners and much more. 5\n\n### • Recognize Indigenous Knowledge in its Own Right\n\n> • Indigenous Knowledge must not be translated, integrated into, or validated by science –  \n> Recognition, trust and respect must be given to the unique contributions of Indigenous  \n> Knowledge as a way of knowing. With a clear understanding that Indigenous Knowledge  \n> holds its own methodologies and objectives, one can begin to appreciate the importance  \n> of not attempting to translate or integrate one source of knowledge into the other. \n\n> • Decisions must be informed by Inuit and our knowledge – This includes all matters  \n> regarding research, management, decision- and policy-making, development, economics  \n> and areas related to the governance of, within, and affecting Inuit Nunaat.\n> \n> • Ensure use of Indigenous Knowledge and final products are peer-reviewed and validated  \n> by Inuit – Our people hold their own unique expertise needed to evaluate approaches,  \n> processes and final products. Scientific information is analyzed with a perspective uniquely  \n> trained to scientists. The same is true of Indigenous Knowledge. While the two sources of  \n> knowledge may complement each other in many cases, they are not the same and should  \n> be appreciated for what each is able to bring to the table.

{"id":"1667307","ref":"162","subject":"Proposal submission expectations","description":"Greetings ACEP Team,  \n \n\nMany of you may have seen the OGCA communication regarding the short-staffing at the central office. In addition, please see the expectations below at our unit-level. \n\n  \n \n\nWe appreciate the expert support provided by Joan and Bob at INE. Please let us know if you have any questions.\n\n*   _Lead Time:_ Adequate lead time is always helpful, but with Sandra's departure it is critical to provide Joan and Bob with _more time_ to review pre-proposals, proposal budgets, white papers, and the like.  The earlier the better! \n*   _Assign a Point Person:_ Assign one point person to interact with the INE pre-award team for proposals that include multiple PIs and/or collaborators. It can be challenging to tease out exactly what part of a proposal needs worked on when emails come from multiple people about the same proposal. Having one person designated to interact with the proposal coordinator and line out specific action items would be helpful.\n*   _Anticipate Tasks:_ Anything the PI can do on their own to move the proposal forward would be helpful (e.g., send budget notes, prepare senior project personnel listing, etc.).\n*   _Provide Specifics about Personnel:_ Please provide specifics about research professional staff on projects. It is not enough to simply suggest a month's salary for a \"research professional\".  We need to know if the PI is proposing to use an RP2, RP3, or RP4 for the work.  If the PI doesn't know, then providing an example of someone with similar level skills/responsibilities would be helpful (e.g., first, last name of human). \n*   _RUSH Requests:_ Rush requests will be difficult to accommodate until the INE proposal office team is fully trained and able to operate efficiently. Please plan accordingly!\n\nThank you everyone,\n\nJoan, Bob and Jennifer\n\n  \n \n\n\\--  \n \n\nJennifer B.

Technology  (OT) Networks\n\n**Funding Request:** $500,000\n\n**Topic Area:**\n\n*   NIST Scientific & Technical Research Services Earmark Account\n*   Department of Energy’s Energy Project Earmark Account\n\n#### Summary\n\n[Operational Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_technology) (OT) networks consist of [supervisory control and data acquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA) (SCADA) and other [industrial control systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_control_system) (ICS) which commonly represent significant cybersecurity risk do to out of date software and firmware which are difficult for a variety of reasons.   Such systems they are often placed in isolated air-gaped networks without connectivity to external networks or the internet, effectively quarantining them off from access by potential malicious actors.  However, such isolation limit the ability to automate, integrate and share data between systems and OT networks.   \n\nFunds are requested to develop and demonstrate how to implement cost effective Zero Trust security for services in OT networks thus facilitating a more secure strategy for rural utility and off grid operational networks.\n\n* * *\n\n### Off Grid Emergency Communication Cyberinfrastructure\n\n**Funding Request:** $2,000,000\n\n**Topic Area:** \n\n*   FEMA Emergency Operations Center Grant Program Earmark Account\n\n#### Summary\n\nIn today's digital world it is increasingly difficult to collaborate without access to Internet bases services for video, voice and chat communications, document and photo sharing, event scheduling and many other services.  Access to these resources is dependent on Internet access.  In remote rural areas, or areas impacted by disaster events cyber-infrastructure either does not exist, or  has been damaged by disaster events.   However, there is no technical reason why two laptops or cellphones with WiFi or Bluetooth radios cannot communicate directly with each other.   \n\nFunds are requested to develop and demonstrate low cost Internet independent cyber-infrastructure to facilitate the easy deployment of off grid video, voice, chat, file sharing, and collaborative document sharing services in a local peer to peer network.  Alaskan rural communities represent an ideal test environment for demonstrating such services.  This project would aim to build completely self contained and readily deploy-able Off Grid Emergency Communication kits with the purpose of demonstrating how to quickly and easily deploy local communication networks without Internet access. \n\n* * *\n\n### Rolling Encryption for Secure Long Term Data Archive\n\n**Funding** Request: $3,000,000\n\n**Topic Area**: \n\n*   National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC) Earmark Account\n*   NIST Scientific & Technical Research Services Earmark Account\n\n#### Summary\n\nAs technology evolves, encryption algorithms that were once considered secure may become trivial to crack in the future.  This makes it difficult to securely archive encrypted data in long term archives.  However, if it were possible to continually re-encrypt data frequently in an automated manner, then data could in principle be securely archived over long periods of time.\n\nFunds are requested to develop and demonstrate cost effect means of providing secure scalable storage solutions for continuously encrypted secure long term data archives.\n\n* * *\n\n### Federated Identity Management for Energy Research Collaboration\n\n**Funding Request:** $1,000,000\n\n**Topic Area:**\n\n*   NIST Scientific & Technical Research Services Earmark Account\n*   Department of Energy’s Energy Project Earmark Account\n\n#### Summary\n\nA major source of risk and and obstacle to broader collaboration between energy researchers, government agencies and small rural utilities is having a common source for securely managing digital identities for cross organizational collaboration and access to shared resources.\n\nFunds are requested to develop and demonstrate cost effect means of integrating federated identities for access to shared resources which facilitate secure and reliable access to shared digital assets by a wide range of collaborators.\n\n* * *\n\n### Operational Technology  (OT) Asset and Identity and Access Management (AM/IAM)\n\n**Funding Request:** $1,000,000\n\n**Topic Area:**\n\n*   NIST Scientific & Technical Research Services Earmark Account\n*   Department of Energy’s Energy Project Earmark Account\n\n#### Summary\n\n[Operational Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_technology) (OT) networks consist of [supervisory control and data acquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA) (SCADA) and other [industrial control systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_control_system) (ICS) which commonly represent significant cyber-security risk do to out of date software and firmware which are difficult for a variety of reasons.    A basic tenet of any cyber-security effort is that “_you cannot protect what you don't know you have, and you cannot protect what you have if you don't know who you can trust_”.   All major cybersecurity compliance frameworks require practitioners to maintain a database of information assets (aka. Asset Management) and database of personal digital identies (aka. Identity Management).\n\nOT systems are notoriously difficult to inventory and document for cyber-security compliance purposes, and often are configured with a single shared account and password because more advance Asset and Identity management services are not available to OT networks.\n\nFunds are requested to develop and demonstrate cost effect means of providing Asset and Identity and Access Management (AM/IAM)        \nservices for use in isolated Operational Technology  (OT) networks.  There by making it possible to reduce security risk in OT networks and facilitate meeting external cyber-security regulatory compliance requirements.\n\n* * *\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pBkIrqL28A8biVXFcc4MWShliQshXwuo](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pBkIrqL28A8biVXFcc4MWShliQshXwuo)\n\n> _**NIST Scientific & Technical Research Services Earmark Account**_\n> \n> _This account can provide grants for certain types of research and equipment acquisition projects related to establishing standards, measurement science, manufacturing, and cybersecurity.

Proposals may contain elements of more than one area. Proposals should focus on transformative science and technology research, development, and demonstration projects. Proposals not eligible for existing programs, tax credits or other federal incentives are more likely to be funded. \n> \n> _Construction or pure equipment acquisition projects are not eligible._ Generally speaking, there are no matching requirements for basic research energy projects. Applied research energy projects require at a minimum 20 percent non-federal match. Demonstration or commercial application energy projects require at a minimum 50 percent non-federal match. \n> \n> _The Alaska Members have shown little interest in supporting energy research projects. Proposals in this appropriations bill compete against Army Corps projects, which have received higher priority from the Alaska Members. Energy research projects that support Alaska Native communities or seek to lower the cost of energy bills for Alaska residents may be of interest. Proposals related to oil and gas research with support from industry may be of interest._\n> \n> **Department of Energy Plus Ups**\n> \n> The UA system has the ability to request additional funding be added to DOE’s budget for a particular purpose. However, UA faculty and researchers must have a relationship with the relevant program manager at DOE. It will be the responsibility of the UA system faculty or researchers to work with the program manager to gain access to any plus up funding. _The UA system will not consider requests unless faculty or researchers can demonstrate an established relationship with a DOE program manager._\n> \n> _Based on the interests of the Alaska Members, it will be very difficult to secure DOE plus ups in FY 25.

Projects can include initiatives such as record digitization, programming, and online availability of records. Archival Equipment acquisition may be eligible in some instances. A 25 percent non-federal match may be required for any project. \n> \n> _New construction projects are not eligible_. Renovation projects may be eligible under certain conditions. \n> \n> _The Alaska Members have shown an interest in projects that preserve any part of the history of Alaska.

CESER is overseeing Section 40126 implementation and has created cybersecurity plan templates that will guide funding recipients to structure a plan that meets their unique levels of risk.\n\nClick on the links below to download the templates:\n\n*   [**High Risk Cybersecurity Plan Template**](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-05/EXEC-2022-008113%20-%20Cybersecurity%20Plan%20Templates_High%20Risk.docx) (doc)\n*   [**Medium Risk Cybersecurity Plan Template**](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-05/EXEC-2022-008113%20-%20Cybersecurity%20Plan%20Templates_Medium%20Risk.docx) (doc)\n*   [**Low Risk Cybersecurity Plan Template**](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-05/EXEC-2022-008113%20-%20Cybersecurity%20Plan%20Templates_Low%20Risk.docx) (doc)\n\nGo [**here**](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-05/Procedure%20for%20the%20Secure%20Transmittal%20of%20Cybersecurity%20Plans%20--%20May%202023_v2.pdf) to access the “Procedure for the Secure Transmittal of Cybersecurity Plans\".\n\n[https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-06/OCED%20Cybersecurity%20Plan%20Guidance.pdf](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-06/OCED%20Cybersecurity%20Plan%20Guidance.pdf)","sprint_id":"","sprint":"","sprint_estimated_start":"","sprint_estimated_finish":"","owner":"jehaverlack","owner_full_name":"John Haverlack","assigned_to":"jehaverlack","assigned_to_full_name":"John Haverlack","status":"Open","severity":"Normal","priority":"Normal","type":"Training","is_closed":"False","attachments":"0","external_reference":"","tags":"infosec,kea","watchers":"[]","voters":"0","created_date":"2023-10-12 21:16:57.833353+00:00","modified_date":"2023-10-12 21:18:50.574080+00:00","finished_date":"","due_date":"","due_date_reason":""}

Our campus is part of the Github Campus program, and so we get Github Enterprise Server and Github Enterprise Cloud for free as long as we agree and follow the terms of the program.  Part of those terms say we act as a single point of contact for Github and answer technical questions from our users.\n> > > \n> > > The best way I can think to explain how the Github Enterprise Cloud works is to break it down into it's various scopes.  The largest scope that we manage is the Enterprise Account.  We have been given a single Github Enterprise account ([https://github.com/enterprises/university-of-alaska](https://github.com/enterprises/university-of-alaska)).  Within the Enterprise Account you have 2 roles: Enterprise Owner and Enterprise Billing Manager.  Enterprise Owners are just like Org Owners except for the Enterprise. Enterprise Owners can do things such as create/invite Organizations, and set overarching policies that apply to every Org in the Enterprise such as requiring SAML auth in addition to Github Auth or requiring 2 Factor authentication.  Currently, a subset of OIT PAWS (and Mike Brase) are the Enterprise Owners, and we require all of our members who have access to manage the Enterprise Account to have 2 Factor on their Github account.  There is also an audit log for every action related to Enterprise Management, Org Management, Team Management, Repo Management, Web Hooks, etc that we can query and export for everything under the Enterprise Account.\n> > > \n> > > The next scope is Orgs.  When an Org is created under the Enterprise Account, or is invited to join the Enterprise Account,  then any member of that Org automatically becomes a member of the Enterprise.  By default, whoever creates the Org will be an Org owner,  but after the Organization is handed over to the department or team that requested it they can then manage that Org including all of it's settings (including SAML and 2 factor) and it's members.  Enterprise Owners can see every Org that is part of the Enterprise Account regardless of whether or not they are a member of that Org.  Recently, Github added the ability for Enterprise Owners to add themselves as an owner of an Enterprise Org, but this is something we only do when requested by the Org owner.\n> > > \n> > > Now the fun part,  Github.com has not really had what we would call traditional IAM until very recently (see Enterprise Managed Users further down).  Traditionally Github has offered only two ways for users to authenticate into Github Enterprise Cloud:\n> > > \n> > > *   [Authentication through GitHub.com](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/identity-and-access-management/managing-iam-for-your-enterprise/about-authentication-for-your-enterprise#authentication-through-githubcom) or\n> > > *   [Authentication through GitHub.com with additional SAML access restriction](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/identity-and-access-management/managing-iam-for-your-enterprise/about-authentication-for-your-enterprise#authentication-through-githubcom-with-additional-saml-access-restriction)\n> > > \n> > > By default, each Org member must create a personal account on GitHub.com. As long as they are a member of an Org that is a part of our Enterprise, they are a member of our Enterprise and can access other Enterprise resources that are scoped to Internal.  If you add SAML authentication to your Org, when an org member signs in with their Github.com account, they will then be forced to sign in via the configured IdP using SAML and link their Github account to an identity in the IdP.  This is useful if user management is critical for an Org and you want people to lose access to the Org as soon as they lose access to other services behind the IdP.  It does make other things more difficult though such as requiring users to reauthenticate to the IdP every 24 hours and authorizing SSH keys and access tokens.  More info can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/about-identity-and-access-management-with-saml-single-sign-on).\n> > > \n> > > The last scope would be Repos.  As you're probably well aware, each repo can have it's own members and permissions and settings, and the visibility can be set to Public, Internal, or Private.  (Internal means other Enterprise members can see it.)  You can also invite Outside Collaborators to a repo.  Outside collaborators do not become a member of the repo or of the Enterprise, and are not subject to any SAML access restriction that might be configured on the Org.  \n> > > \n> > > Github has only recommended organizations require members to create a new Github.com account specifically for the Org / Enterprise if they need to minimize risk of developers _accidentally_ pushing valuable data to another Org or Gist outside of the Enterprise.  If the Enterprise's developers are trusted, then the recommendation is to use personal Github accounts so users can get the attributions and stats that come with doing work such as commits, pull requests, and merges.   Once a user's account is no longer a member of an Enterprise Org, they will lose access to all of the Enterprise's resources, but they will still have the stats of how many commits they have done for example.  On each Org the user can also configure what email and name should be used,  so even though my Github.com personal account is Sutekidayo, on every UA Enterprise Org I use Travis Payton and [tpayton1@alaska.edu](mailto:tpayton1@alaska.edu) for attribution and notifications.  The most flexibility we have to automate user provisioning is to send Org invites via an API call to email addresses.  However, a user must still have or create a Github.com account in order to accept the invite.\n> > > \n> > > Github has recently released a third authentication option called [Github Enterprise Managed Users](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-enterprise-managed-users-for-iam/about-enterprise-managed-users).  It only supports Azure AD and Okta, and the ODIC account management is still in Beta and only for Azure AD currently.  Enterprise Managed Users are exactly what they sound like -- they are basically a super restricted Github.com account that we can provision and manage, but they can only be a member of an Enterprise's Orgs and can only access repos within the Enterprise's orgs.  The downside is it is either all or nothing. If we want to use Managed Users we will need to contact sales and migrate to a new Github Enterprise Account.  Also, a Github Enterprise Account that is using Managed Users can not have any public repos. Everything must be Private or Internal.\n> > > \n> > > Due to the nature of our Enterprise Account being used by Students, Staff, and Faculty for a wide range of things, we refrain from setting restrictive policies on the Enterprise Account level and recommend the more restrictive settings be handled on an org-by-org basis.  If you would like to get SAML setup on your Org(s), we can assist with that.   \n> > > \n> > > One last thing to note is last time I was reviewing security standards for ACUASI I discovered that Github Enterprise Cloud is not authorized for ITAR data, but a properly hosted Github Enterprise Server is.  I don't believe UA OIT could host ITAR data as we employ non-US citizens such as permanent residents and some student employees, but if you would like to host your own Github Enterprise Server we can provide you with a license as well.     \n> > >  \n> > > \n> > > Hopefully that all makes sense.  Let me know what other questions you have now as well. :)\n> > > \n> > > Thanks,\n> > > \n> > > Travis Payton   \n> > > Sr. Engineering Manager\n> > > \n> > > OIT Platforms, Applications, & Web Services\n> > > \n> > > Butrovich 105E\n> > > \n> > > 907-474-2621\n> > > \n> > > On Tue, Jul 12, 2022 at 5:34 PM Dayne Broderson <[dayne@alaska.edu](mailto:dayne@alaska.edu)\\> wrote:   \n> > >  \n> > > \n> > > > Walker, Travis, Doug, and Mike,\n> > > > \n> > > > I am working through some questions about if ACEP can use our GitHub Cloud Enterprise account as a place to manage some critical energy infrastructure information provided to us under an NDA.\n> > > > \n> > > > Given that GitHub Cloud Enterprise accounts are FedRAMP authorized (P-ATO) I would say the answer is yes as long as we've got a good handle as University of Alaska on our management of our GitHub.\n> > > > \n> > > > A few things jump out to me as likely needing review and clean-up at the organizational level: \n> > > > \n> > > > *   Admin information is currently: [doug.knight@karmix.org](mailto:doug.knight@karmix.org)   \n> > > >     That should be a @alaska.edu identity.\n> > > > *   There are  7 organization admins currently listed:   \n> > > >     [https://github.com/orgs/acep-uaf/people/enterprise\\_owners](https://github.com/orgs/acep-uaf/people/enterprise_owners)   \n> > > >     That should be reviewed for any updates/clean-up needed.\n> > > > *   I need to know who is the right POC to talk to about expanding our GitHub LFS quota and paying for that.    \n> > > >     We are currently using 2.1GB of 1GB of our github LFS quota and I would like to expand that usage significantly but want to understand how to handle any possible costs that will be triggered when I do that.\n> > > > *   Who is the right cybersecurity POC who could help us review and play the UA system role in our system security plan for our GitHub platform?\n> > > > \n> > > > Best,\n> > > > \n> > > > \\-dayne\n> > > > \n> > > > \\--   \n> > > >  \n> > > > \n> > > > [dayne@alaska.edu](mailto:dayne@alaska.edu) | 907-590-1066 | [acep.uaf.edu](http://acep.uaf.edu/)   \n> > > >  \n> \n> \\--   \n>  \n> \n> [dayne@alaska.edu](mailto:dayne@alaska.edu) | 907-590-1066 | [acep.uaf.edu](http://acep.uaf.edu/)","sprint_id":"","sprint":"","sprint_estimated_start":"","sprint_estimated_finish":"","owner":"jehaverlack","owner_full_name":"John Haverlack","assigned_to":"jehaverlack","assigned_to_full_name":"John Haverlack","status":"New","severity":"Important","priority":"High","type":"Policy","is_closed":"False","attachments":"0","external_reference":"","tags":"ci,code,data,infosec","watchers":"[]","voters":"0","created_date":"2023-10-19 00:32:04.900030+00:00","modified_date":"2023-10-20 20:44:27.248857+00:00","finished_date":"","due_date":"","due_date_reason":""}

This FOA aims to support the development and demonstration of technologies, tools, or systems that enable secure communications of data and control messaging between grid edge infrastructure and distribution system operators.\n\nThe grid edge is where utility service ends and customer equipment starts. Specifically, the grid edge begins at customers’ meter points and includes their own equipment, software, and controls. Examples include rooftop solar systems, electric vehicle charging stations, and energy storage solutions.\n\nThe FOA’s objective is to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of new communications solutions on utility infrastructure, and to demonstrate how legacy grid communications infrastructure and operating standards can be updated to support coordination of distributed energy resources on the distribution system. To keep the lights on for consumers, it is critical that the grid quickly responds and recovers from disruption.\n\n*   If DOE issues the FOA, it will be posted at [**Grants.gov**](https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDIsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsInVybCI6Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cuZ3JhbnRzLmdvdj91dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9Z292ZGVsaXZlcnkiLCJidWxsZXRpbl9pZCI6IjIwMjMxMTIwLjg1OTI2MzIxIn0.CvVKXCKLN7E_iRYsk6QWpjVoXl0uzahLIFQKJqHd45E/s/2939946849/br/231268432639-l) and at [**FedConnect**](https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDMsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsInVybCI6Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cuZmVkY29ubmVjdC5uZXQ_dXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPWdvdmRlbGl2ZXJ5IiwiYnVsbGV0aW5faWQiOiIyMDIzMTEyMC44NTkyNjMyMSJ9.p-S0-TWP3YpX8kqanfQpG-stozzLdXK0VBBg-1P7mwI/s/2939946849/br/231268432639-l).

I wanted to reach out to discuss potential partnership opportunities **concerning the January 12th concept papers for the Grid Deployment Office. Topic area 2: Smart Grid Grants allows for institutions of higher education to join.** Overall grants are $1B, with typical grant at $50M. \n\nC3 AI is a world leading AI/ML enterprise solutions company. We are conducting work with the National Labs and DoE. C3 AI’s CTO and President Ed Abbo also recently presented to the subcommittee on energy, climate, and grid security on “The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Powering America’s Future.” We are also connecting with the Deputy Secretary of DoE and head of Grid Modernization within GDO, because of interest in our AI/ML solutions to the grid. C3 AI has years of experience related to Grid applications, utilities, and energy to include:\n\n*   Reducing power outages and threats\n*   Ensuring optimal health of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI)\n*   Developing enterprise AI for digital engineering, providing digital twin capabilities\n*   Employing enterprise AI for stakeholder intelligence, energy management, and monitoring ESG materiality\n*   Leveraging edge computing to enable smart grid and smart city services\n*   Providing cybersecurity and intelligence forecasts related to the energy\n*   Enhancing advanced manufacturing processes      \n     \n\nOur logos include **Shell, ConEd, Duke Energy.**  We also have experience working with UARCs, such as work at the Applied Physics Lab at Johns Hopkins/DoD. I would love to get time with your team to see how we can partner, whether through grants or to help on current R&D. Currently, we are working with a National Lab, taking TRL 2 concepts to TRL 6, related to cybersecurity, the grid and digital engineering. Also in terms of GDO funding, **we are looking to potentially partner as we move closer to this second round of funding.** C3 AI is uniquely positioned to solve these requirements.\n\nWe’d love to set up a time to connect to see how our two teams can work together on this next round, or to see if C3 AI can help solve any problems your team is facing today. Please let me know some availabilities that work to set up a meeting. We look forward to hearing from you soon! \n\nBest,\n\nNicholas Galanos      \nSenior Director, Strategic Solutions      \nTysons, Virginia","sprint_id":"","sprint":"","sprint_estimated_start":"","sprint_estimated_finish":"","owner":"jehaverlack","owner_full_name":"John Haverlack","assigned_to":"","assigned_to_full_name":"","status":"Open","severity":"Important","priority":"Urgent","type":"Proposal","is_closed":"False","attachments":"0","external_reference":"","tags":"acep,doe,c3ai,grip","watchers":"[557887]","voters":"0","created_date":"2023-11-22 17:21:59.372014+00:00","modified_date":"2023-12-01 21:02:57.161200+00:00","finished_date":"","due_date":"","due_date_reason":""}

Bumping to the top of your inbox!\\]\n\n  \n \n\nApplications are still open for the internship program until January 8. However, we already have 50+ applications that have been submitted, and every project has applicants! This would be a great time to start combing through the applications, as we will need your final top 3 interview choices by January 12.\n\n  \n \n\n**Now:** browse applicants-- they will continue to populate as they are submitted. I have a \"notepad\" set up on your project page so you can take notes on applicants as you read them.\n\n**Jan 9-12:** Application closes. Decide + submit your top 3 choices for interviews on your project page.\n\n**End of January-mid Feb:** Patty and I will be scheduling interviews.\n\n  \n \n\nFIRST!! Please watch this [6 minute video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gFoxWr9UPdTua1-GOXWqAVUtCxIT-1_B/view?usp=sharing) where I walk through the different pieces of the interface and the process for submitting your interview choices. It's pretty much the same as last year, but there is a new process for submitting your final selections. You can listen to it at double time and hear Chipmunk Annalise cruise through it in 3 minutes if that's all the time you have.\n\n  \n \n\nThen you can head over to the [interface](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invhUDAR6lmdPQyCC&inviteToken=5327c0f0a7ae9905012d88fcac6904f5d02c480783ca0f124f0667c7bb9b8197&utm_medium=email&utm_source=product_team&utm_content=transactional-alerts). If you haven't made an Airtable account before, you'll need to do that through your UAF account. Let me know if you have any questions.\n\n  \n \n\nThanks!","sprint_id":"","sprint":"","sprint_estimated_start":"","sprint_estimated_finish":"","owner":"jehaverlack","owner_full_name":"John Haverlack","assigned_to":"jehaverlack","assigned_to_full_name":"John Haverlack","status":"New","severity":"Normal","priority":"High","type":"Task","is_closed":"False","attachments":"0","external_reference":"","tags":"acep","watchers":"[]","voters":"0","created_date":"2024-01-03 21:41:19.029057+00:00","modified_date":"2024-01-03 21:41:43.967422+00:00","finished_date":"","due_date":"","due_date_reason":""}

The university falls into this category.\n\nWithout going into too much technical detail, this means that any third-party platform we use to send emails (things like MailChimp or Salesforce or Cision) must be DMARC compliant or we risk getting our IP addresses blacklisted, which would make mass distribution of emails impossible. \n\n**No later than close-of-business on Jan. 9,** please send me a list of any third-party platforms you use to send mass emails to people and the point-of-contact on your team for those platforms (so, for example, I am point-of-contact for our Merit subscription). If you use a PR or marketing agency, you should also find out whether they use a third-party platform to send emails on your behalf and, if so, list those as well. I’ll share that with the IT folks and they should be able to help with next steps.\n\nThanks,\n\nMG\n\nMarmian Grimes    \nPublic information officer    \nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks    \n907-474-7902 (office)    \n907-460-4750 (mobile)    \n[marmian.grimes@alaska.edu](mailto:marmian.grimes@alaska.edu)    \n@MarmianGrimes\n\n\\--    \n \n\n\\-Amanda Byrd\n\nChief Storyteller\n\nAlaska Center for Energy and Power\n\nOffice of Intellectual Property and Commercialization\n\n4th floor, ELIF - UAF Campus\n\nFairbanks, Alaska 99775     \n \n\n[See our Community Energy Stories Here.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ_aYEKT8q8wQh2b053stawIn7MRR0gp1)\n\nPh:  (907) 978-0305    \n \n\nFax: (907) 474 5475","sprint_id":"","sprint":"","sprint_estimated_start":"","sprint_estimated_finish":"","owner":"jehaverlack","owner_full_name":"John Haverlack","assigned_to":"jehaverlack","assigned_to_full_name":"John Haverlack","status":"Closed","severity":"Normal","priority":"Urgent","type":"Security Review","is_closed":"True","attachments":"0","external_reference":"","tags":"acep,infosec","watchers":"[557887]","voters":"0","created_date":"2024-01-04 21:10:52.045036+00:00","modified_date":"2024-01-10 02:05:40.256283+00:00","finished_date":"2024-01-10 02:05:40.260675+00:00","due_date":"2024-01-09","due_date_reason":""}
